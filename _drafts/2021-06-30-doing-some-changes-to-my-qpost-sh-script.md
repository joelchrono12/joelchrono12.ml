I recently joined a tilde communitiy
I have also tried to make my git workflow better
I am using this file to test how pushing to multiple repos works
Each line is a commit lmao
I figured out how to do this thanks to this [gist](https://gist.github.com/rvl/c3f156e117e22a25f242) from GitHub
Alright, one last attempt

Ok, if everything worked, this should be it
