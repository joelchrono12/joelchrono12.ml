My grandmother passed away. Honestly, I was not really affected by the news, even if it was too sudden, we had talked to her on the phone only a week or so earlier. She was healthy and strong, still walking and working without any help, if slower than before. My dad and I were with some friends about to have a BBQ when he got a phone call. When a lot of time went by I decided to leave the meeting for a bit and look for him. I realized something bad had happened. I went back, and messaged my sister asking for updates on what was happening, I was told to go, I had my suspicions and they were confirmed. I have to admit I had an intrusive thought, of being like Albert Camus'_The Stranger_ and pretend I didn't actually care much, I have to admit, I was ok, I did not cry at all, I just hugged my family.

Me and my dad went back to our friends, were he explained the situation, they prayed for us and my family, and we still ate and enjoyed the time as best as we could. After it was over, we went back home and got ready for the trip tomorrow.

Time was honestly, as good as it can be. The trip was long and I listened to many podcasts, read some pages of my books and slept quite a bit. Once we arrived it was good to see my father's family again. They are strong, my cousins were fun, and everyone was really holding as best as possible, my grandma's body was on the next room, I was about to go after my siblings were going too, but we all stopped on our tracks, I could not handle it, my mom had gone ahead and cried while hugging one of my aunts. I refused to go in at least for now.

Laughs, jokes, memories, laughs, some crying. There were many visits from people I didn't know at all, but I didn't have to talk to them either so it was fine. I convinced a couple of cousins to install some mobile games and play together. We also had a nice chat with everyone later on. It was honestly really chill and that night was very wholesome.

The next day we all walked to the town's graveyard, a rather small place were all graves are all over each other. There was another ceremony, my father gave some words of comfort, and everyone got another chance to see my grandmother one last time and bless her soul. It was then that my little act of being "strong" faded, along with everyone else. I cried, my whole family did. She didn't look nowhere near as strong as I remembered her, It had only been a few months since the last time I saw her in person, alive and well. I will miss her a lot.
