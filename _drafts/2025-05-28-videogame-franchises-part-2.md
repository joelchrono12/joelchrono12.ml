## The Legend of Heroes: Trails...

Can I really talk about Trails when I haven't even finished one of them? Well, I actually haven't finished any Final Fantasy either, so ignore me.

This franchise is a massive undertaking, it's simply overwhelming and kinda scary, and yet, it feels so epic and thought-out, even if I don't know what it's about, all I know is that anyone who gets into it becomes an *absolute sicko.*

I've made progress in the first game, around 11 hours of playtime. But that is literally nothing, I still have like 90 hours left, I think.

For this one the case is clear. Start from the beginning, no way around it. It is a grand story across multiple titles, hundreds of hours of gameplay and cutscenes. There are some people saying you can start with the first game of any of the trilogies (yes, this series has multiple trilogies), but you would still miss out on some things.

The reason I mention these games at all even if I haven't come close to finish even one, is that there is a remake of the first entry coming to modern platforms this year. I highly anticipate its arrival to Switch, as it's something I really wish to get into.

The physical editions for these games rise in value very quickly as well, so I want to get my hands on one as fast as possible.

## Metroid

The franchise with more games I have actually played to completion, somehow. This series was introduced to me by the same friend who showed me Final Fantasy and Pokem√≥n. So yeah this guy basically shaped my whole personality and bias towards videogames.

Anyway, Metroid was definitely the coolest of the game he showed me, so colorful, with a huge variety of rooms and places to explore. I vividly remember him playing the game and explaining things, getting to the first boss of Metroid Fusion and obtaining the first power-up. It was a sight to behold.

I started with either *Zero Mission* or *Fusion*, for the GBA, both on a computer and on my PSP, years later. I completed them for the first time on that device, although last year I also replayed them on my Miyoo Mini Plus and my Anbernic RG35XX SP.

Metroid Fusion is probably the best entry into the franchise, but at the same time it's also the most different of all the Metroid games, so I think Zero Mission still takes the cake in that regard, as it is a remake of the first game of the series anyway. Of course, there's also the Prime series which is in first person, I am yet to try it, but the Remastered edition for the Nintendo Switch is still a good option, I also have it physical, and I also have not played it yet.

## Monster Hunter

I didn't even consider Monster Hunter on this list when I started writing this article, but of course! It makes total sense.

This is one of the best franchises ever! A simple premise, constant evolution and improvements, new monsters and new armor designs. Monster Hunter is always tweaking the formula, while keeping what makes it special and fun. It goes something like this:

*Get stick, hit monster, get loot, repeat.*

I got started with Monster Hunter when I was looking for fun games to play on my PSP. Alongside *Peace Walker* and *Ys Seven*, *Monster Hunter Freedom Unite* showed up, and it was breah-taking. The scale of the fights, the animations and the graphics, it looked so cool, it made Ys look like a game for kids---what is it with me judging games so quickly? Both are good.

I started it, and proceeded to pickup herbs and mushrooms for like 40 minutes, then I hit some antilopes and weird mammoths that didn't fight back, trying to carve a specific part that didn't drop for a while. Oh, and the camera controls sucked.

And yet, 400+ hours later, this game has provided me with some of the most epic, wholesome and interesting gaming experiences of my life!

I've talked so much about it you should just [check out](/blog/returning-to-monster-hunter/) my [previous blog posts](/blog/the-monster-hunter-online-experience/) on it.

I've emulated *Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate* and I also played *Monster Hunter Generations* on a friend's 3DS. All of them are similar and so fun, just play whichever one you have!

I've also played some *Monster Hunter Rise* on my Switch pretty constantly, as well as the Japan exclusive *Monster Hunter Portable 3rd*.

I got *Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate* waiting for me on Switch for a while now, but since I still have lots of progress to make with Rise, I haven't started it yet.

The best Monster Hunter to get into is always the latest one. The second best option, is *Monster Hunter Freedom Unite!* (Or *Rise*, I guess).
