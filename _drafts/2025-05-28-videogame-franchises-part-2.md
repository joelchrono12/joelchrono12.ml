## Dragon Quest

I will admit, once again, that I was a bit of a snob when I got into JRPGs, and even though I would say "Final Fantasy is better than Fire Emblem because it came first", I could not think that "Dragon Quest came before Final Fantsy so it must be better too".

For the longest time, I thought that the battle system of Final Fantasy was just the normal thing. "Active Time Battle" combat, where enemies attack while you are still choosing what spell to use in the menus. Turns out, that of course not. Dragon Quest is just turn based, and it just lets you think every action and enjoy the game.

The first time I tried it was with Dragon Quest III for the SNES. I wanted to participate in a certain challenge where you are assigned a random party to play with. I ended up dropping the game as soon as I selected my party members, I don't even remember doing a battle on it.

Then, on a whim some day, I saw Dragon Quest XI on discount in Mercado Libre, and I pulled the trigger.

I have played it for more than 20 hours now, on and off, from time to
time, and I am absolutely in love with this game.

However, I think that now that the HD-2D remake DQ3, and the one for 1+2 coming soon too, I believe those would be better ways to get into the franchise. Simply because XI apparently has lots of references for long time players. I am personally unaffected by this, but if you don't wanna miss out, consider the original trilogy. I heard the original titles ported to the Game Boy Color have a lot of charm as well!

## Ys

This is a long time running franchise that I absolutely love. I discovered much later in my life, and I appreciate what it does quite a bit.

Basically, it follows the life of Adol, a hero who helps whoever is in need. The games are all action RPGs, in the style of The Legend of Zelda, but with more focus on combat and less in puzzles. It also borrows some Metroidvania elements, like locked pathways under certain abilities or equipment, and backtracking to completed dungeons to get new items.

I got started with *Ys Seven* on my PSP, before I even knew it was a franchise, and I was just amazed by it. It had some awesome attacks, skills and animation, great boss battles and a lot of playable characters I could switch between to do different kinds of attacks. it's one of the few games I completed in 2023.

After that, I have acquired *Ys VIII* and *Ys Origins* for my Nintendo Switch, and I plan to buy *Ys X* sometime soon. I have not even played many of these games, but I just trust the people behind these games with my life.

I am currently playing *Ys: The Oath in Felghana*, a remake of the 3rd game of the franchise. This one lacks combo moves and a character party, but it manages to perfect the essentials of an action rpg, have a pretty decent story, fun characters and a lot of tough as nails boss fights! I am about to face the final boss, and will do so after I upgrade my equipment one last time!

There are a lot of differences between the games, the first two feature bump combat, later on they used semi 3D combat from aerial view (like *Oath* and *Seven*) and then they went fully 3D and 3rd person view. I am yet to play the original combat style, and I have only played a bit of the demo of *Ys X*, I really think any game of this franchise is a good starting point.

## Metal Gear Solid

I always loved spy and secret agent stories, so when I learned about this franchise, I was into it! I didn't even know that it also featured giant mecha robots sometimes, so that's cool.

This is a series I haven't followed that much. I have played *Metal Gear Solid* for the PS1 on my PSP, and I made quite a bit of progress on it. However, this is one save file I did lose, right before the fight against Psycho Mantis.

On the PSP I also had *Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker*, a fantastic game that is simply incredible on the PSP, and it was a joy to play. However, for some reason, I abandoned it, I think it was a boss I couldn't beat, the game was designed with co-op multiplayer in mind, and some of the bosses can be a bit difficult for that reason.

so I started the PS1 OG again, over on my RG35XX SP handheld, but I haven't reached the same point as on my PSP yet.

Nowadays I think the original trilogy is available almost everywhere, even the original title for PS1 holds up quite well compared to other PS1 released that year. I'd say it's a great starting point, but I haven't played the others so...

## The Legend of Heroes: Trails...

Can I really talk about Trails when I haven't even finished one of them? Well, I actually haven't finished any Final Fantasy either, so ignore me.

This franchise is a massive undertaking, it's simply overwhelming and kinda scary, and yet, it feels so epic and thought-out, even if I don't know what it's about, all I know is that anyone who gets into it becomes an *absolute sicko.*

I've made progress in the first game, around 11 hours of playtime. But that is literally nothing, I still have like 90 hours left, I think.

For this one the case is clear. Start from the beginning, no way around it. It is a grand story across multiple titles, hundreds of hours of gameplay and cutscenes. There are some people saying you can start with the first game of any of the trilogies (yes, this series has multiple trilogies), but you would still miss out on some things.

The reason I mention these games at all even if I haven't come close to finish even one, is that there is a remake of the first entry coming to modern platforms this year. I highly anticipate its arrival to Switch, as it's something I really wish to get into.

The physical editions for these games rise in value very quickly as well, so I want to get my hands on one as fast as possible.

## Monster Hunter

I didn't even consider Monster Hunter on this list when I started writing this article, but of course! It makes total sense.

This is one of the best franchises ever! A simple premise, constant evolution and improvements, new monsters and new armor designs. Monster Hunter is always tweaking the formula, while keeping what makes it special and fun. It goes something like this:

*Get stick, hit monster, get loot, repeat.*

I got started with Monster Hunter when I was looking for fun games to play on my PSP, Freedom Unite showed up in some videos, and it was amazing. The scale of the fights, the animations and the graphics, it looked so cool!

I started it, and proceeded to pickup herbs and mushrooms for like 40 minutes, then I hit some antilopes and weird mammoths that didn't fight back, trying to get some specific part that didn't show up for a while. Oh, and the camera controls sucked.

And yet, 400+ hours later, this is easily one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had!

I've talked so much about it you should just check out my previous blog posts on it.

I've emulated *Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate* and I also played *Monster Hunter Generations* on a friend's 3DS. All of them are similar and so fun, just play whichever one you have!

I've also played some *Monster Hunter Rise* on my Switch pretty constantly, as well as the Japan exclusive *Monster Hunter Portable 3rd*.

I got *Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate* waiting for me on Switch for a while now, but since I still have lots of progress to make with Rise, I haven't started it yet.

The best Monster Hunter to get into is always the latest one. The second best option, is Monster Hunter Freedom Unite! (Or Rise, I guess).

## Metroid

The franchise with more games I have actually played to completion, somehow. This series was introduced to me by the same friend who showed me Final Fantasy and Pokem√≥n. So yeah this guy basically shaped my whole personality and bias towards videogames.

Anyway, Metroid was definitely the coolest of the game he showed me, so colorful, with a huge variety of rooms and places to explore. I vividly remember him playing the game and explaining things, getting to the first boss of Metroid Fusion and obtaining the first power-up. It was a sight to behold.

I started with either *Zero Mission* or *Fusion*, for the GBA, both on a computer and on my PSP, years later. I completed them for the first time on that device, although last year I also replayed them on my Miyoo Mini Plus and my Anbernic RG35XX SP.

Metroid Fusion is probably the best entry into the franchise, but at the same time it's also the most different of all the Metroid games, so I think Zero Mission still takes the cake in that regard, as it is a remake of the first game of the series anyway. Of course, there's also the Prime series which is in first person, I am yet to try it, but the Remastered edition for the Nintendo Switch is still a good option, I also have it physical, and I also have not played it yet.

## Castlevania

This is the franchise that inspired this blog post! I have been playing Castlevania Aria of Sorrow on and off during the year, and I've had a blast with it. It's kind of weird because my total playtime isn't even 5 hours yet, but I guess that's what happens when you abuse save states like me.

It's hard to believe that I never really tried this franchise in my childhood years, as I've known of it for ages, and I've played Metroid, the game it shares a whole genre name with, for more than a decade.

Anyway, each game in this franchise is barely connected to each other, like Final Fantasy, so you can pretty much start with any of them. Of course, some are better than others.

Personally, I've only significantly played *Aria of Sorrow*. I've played *Super Castlevania IV*, for like 20 minutes too. Other than that, I'm blind.

Still, those two and *Symphony of The Night* are considered the best entry points of the series, Aria and Symphony are what eventually set the foundations alongside Metroid, to the Metroidvania genre, and Super Castlevania is the epitome of the classic, more linear gameplay style.

I actually own the Advance and the Dominus Collection physical editions for Nintendo Switch for some reason. I just like the personality of the games I guess, I look forward to playing them someday.
