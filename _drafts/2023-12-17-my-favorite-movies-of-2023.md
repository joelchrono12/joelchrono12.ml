I struggle to keep track of the movies I watch, I generally don't count the ones I started midway or where I missed the ending and such, which usually happens when another family member watches them.

Regardless I don't think that matters much to you, so I'll just list the whole list of movies and pick 5 of them.

My favorite movie of the year is definitely Across The Spiderverse

From first to last, here are the movies I remember watching this year.

- Princess Mononoke
- The Beast with a Million Eyes
- Elysium
- Whisper of the Heart
- Emergency Declaration
- The Super Mario Bros. Movie
- Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania
- Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3
- Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse
- The Flash
- Honest Thief
- Ratatouille
- X-Men
- X-Men: The Last Stand
- X-Men: Days of Future Past
- X-Men: Dark Phoenix
