## The Machine Stops

After reading _I Have no Mouth and I Must Scream_ a year or so ago, I gained quite a bit of appreciation for short stories. They are great! I get a tiny package that can contain quite a bit of good ideas and story-telling, while not requiring a lot of time to be read.

The Machine Stops, by E. M. Forster, was a fantastic short story that blew me away almost as much as the previously mentioned anthology.

It was published in 1909, and yet it contains one of the scariest, most accurate depictions of what a world dominated by reliance on technology could look like---and one might say, already looks like today.

While Orwell's 1984---published in 1939--deals with a corrupt form of government using surveillance, rewriting history and in a state of constant war; the world in The Machine Stops is seemingly perfect.

Humanity lives underground after the atmosphere is no longer inhabitable. There's an hexagonal room for everyone to live in, everything can be reached at the press of a button: food, music, films, literature, a bed, instant video communication.

Ideas, knowledge, cannot, and should not, be obtained from their original source. It is wrong after all, since feelings and experiences only undermine reality and facts.

Physical contact is frowned upon, you don't visit people in person. Water is hot, the lights are comfortable. You can request to become a parent, you can request euthanasia, but birth and death rates have to stay balanced. No matter, there is no pain anymore, the Machine knows best.

Travelling is mostly unnecessary, but flying machines exist, although everyone closes their windows, nobody wants the Sun shining over them, nobody wants to look down to the old cities and landscapes found in the surface, there are no ideas to be gained there.

I don't usually talk so much about what a book contains, but this is just the idea and the setting, there is also a story to be told, despite it all being so short, there's still a lot more. It is an easy read to fly through in a single sitting. I highly recommend it.


## The Internet and the Machine

My previous post was a review of The Machine Stops, a short story by E. M. Forster that was simply incredible and everyone should read it.

Literally while writing the review, I stumbled upon a piece of writing that, if everyone had read this book and taken it as a warning instead of an instruction manual, probably would not even need to exist, for the problems shown there pretty much are what we are living today, is what's happening now that the Machine is starting to fail.

We have our buttons to get food and music and content in front of us. We have phones and apps and websites as frontends to ultimately interact with people whenever we are buying food. We have evolved to moving things to us, rather than moving ourselves.

Somehow there's competition

Surely getting the information from AI generated websites must be better, after all, removing all humanity and emotion from the information we consume can only improve upon it, and if we run all of that through another AI to summarize it, now we got exactly what we need. Pure facts, pure objectivity, proper ideas.

Tthe people "in power", the thinkers who will tell you "everything will be fine", the fanatics who will say "the Machine will not fail us", "let's give it time to settle down"; The Commitees we go complain to and just redirect it to a different commitee, they are blind, or they are just as confused as us.

Eventually, you get used to the stinky atmosphere, you get used to the poorly written literature, you get used to the failing communication services. We never needed any of that anyway.
