Picking out 25 favorite games is a harder task than one might think. And it's not even because of number 1, that's actually the easiest for me---you probably already know it. But I would have to make a list of all the games I've played, and then just, pick and choose.

I actually already tried to do this more than a year ago, this post was originally started in May of 2024. Since then

This is what came out of my memory at the time, just in case you want to know already. It is quite different to the final list at all, so it's not really a spoiler. Still, if you want a peek, serve yourself.

This was kind of hard honestly, there are some games missing from my original selection that didn't make it for various reason. Some are just kind of obvious, like, I decided to not put Mario Kart 8 just for variety. And I also tried to avoid repeating franchises unless the entries were like, significantly different from each other (such as the 3 Zeldas in here, or the 2 Mario games). Anyway, let's get started

## Honorable mentiones

### Super Mario Galaxy

This is top tier 3D Mario, the game I played whenever I visted that one friend who had a Nintendo Wii (other than Mario Kart Wii), and it was some of the most fun I ever had, I could repeat levels over and over and try new ways and find secrets and just enjoy life and be a kid.

The power-ups, the music, the levels, the nostalgia is strong on this one, an absolutely great game that definitely marked my childhood.

### Terranigma

Terranigma is a game I love, it is also the game I've convinced the most content creators to play---3 people actually---and it is kind of a weird one.

The game borrows a lot from Zelda and also from its predecessors. It's an Action RPG with a fairly thought provoking story about the reconstruction of the World, and humanity itself.

The game is a true hidden gem that didn't come to the Americas. The gameplay holds up well, and there are multiple attack moves you can do, without having to equip a certain weapon or item, it's actually rather epic, kind of feels like a 2D Monster Hunter---you don't hunt monsters though.

I have to admit I have not completed this game just yet. I still have a save file with 13 hours in it and another one with 9 hours. But I feel compelled to starting it once again because why not, and since I got my Miyoo Mini Plus, I may do it soon.

### Final Fantasy VII

I had a hard time justifying this game being in my list, don't get me wrong, it is a good game, but I have not completed it even once, or come close. I've played barely enough to see all of what the game has to offer. I was a bit annoyed after I could not progress any further since my PSP crashed during an FMV sequence in the game, but after I transferred it to my Miyoo Mini Plus, and then my Anbernic RG35XX SP, I have been able to play it on and off. I will one day finish this game and maybe I'll have to reconsider this one on my list.

### Balatro

This is one of the newest games in my list, it came out earlier this year and it has proven to be quite addictive. I am not as crazy as others on it, but I decided to put it here just because it's beautifully simplistic in its gameplay and mechanics, but it manages to be much deeper than one might originally think. Deck builders are a genre I haven't explored much, other than this one and Marvel Snap, which is also a fantastic game on its own as well.

I still have not won a match of Balatro, I've gotten close, but maybe one of these days I'll finally manage to beat it, I have to keep trying!

### Lumines

This is a game that kind of looks like Tetris and kind of plays like Tetris, but it is not Tetris at all. Lumines is a great game where the main objective is to form 2x2 squares, which can be combined to bigger sizes, they'll get swooshed away and make space for more squares to come. All of this is done to the rythm of the music playing in different stages, all with different tempos and themes. The music in some stages is simply incredible, and sometimes it's just a bunch of computer sounds that don't sound as nice.

Regardless, the gameplay itself is very satisfying, you can empty the whole screen in one fell swoop if you pay attention to the square placement and such, and it is a very great game that puts you into the zone. The people who worked on this game eventually did _Tetris Effect_ as well, but I have not had the chance to play that one.


## The final list (for now)

### 25

### 24

### 23. Into The Breach

I have not played a lot of tactical RPGs, and a roguelite at that? If Lumines gets me into the zone where I just focus and flow with the music and gameplay, Into The Breach will make my head actually think about every little choice and step to face every challenge found here. The game design here is simply incredible. 

In this game you get to control three mecha robots, and defend the cities from the Vek, giant insectoid creatures that come from the underground. The cool thing about this is that you get to know exactly what moves the enemies will do, which makes it so you can technically win every encounter in a single try if you take your time and make the right choices.

I played it for a while on my laptop, but I ended up buying it on Switch as well because it really was that good, I managed to unlock the final island to complete a run of the game, but I kinda don't want to mess it up! Soon I'll finish one.

### 22. Star Wars: The Force Unleashed

This game was the first game I had on my PSP. It was a fantastic showcase of the PSP's power and just blew me away as a kid. It follows the story of Vader's secret apprentice towards a path of discovery and redemption. I loved that you can customize your character quite a bit, there are a lot of costumes and lightsaber colors, collectibles and new force powers to unlock.

The gameplay in general follows a similar style to God of War, just some levels with enemies you have to fight through, some puzzles to make things interesting and also great boss fights with quick time events. There are many epic moments and the force powers bring a lot of variety to the combat, so unlocking them is worth it.

However, other than the main story. There is a lot of extra content to enjoy, recreating a bunch of fights from the movies and moments not seen on screen as well. All of these are fantastic extras that aren't found in the Xbox and Playstation versions. A great game to have on your PSP if you are a Star Wars fan.

### 21. Parasite Eve

Behold, the first JRPG of the my list. Parasite Eve was quite a revelation for me, I don't really remember how I came across it for the first time, but when I did, I thought it was a really cool game with incredible graphics for the PS1, that looked even better on my PSP. I loved the gameplay for this one, since it was a sort of active time battle mode, but with guns. You could move closer to enemies to get in range, improve damage and so, and also avoid getting hit and reposition yourself. 

The story was quite strange, with neat science fiction elements that kind of left you fearing this could happen in real life. I was so amused by the premise that I ended up reading the original novel (that serves as a prequel to the game) and watching the japanese movie---fairly accurate to the novel. The science behind it all was fascinating to me, and the references in the game were neat. Sadly, I did not finish the game since I got stuck in one part and other things took over, but the gameplay and style are really good and hold up well today---other than the slow running speed.

### 20. Metroid Fusion

These is one of the first games I ever emulated, alongside  Zero Mission, some Pokemon and Final Fantasy stuff. This is a fantastic introduction to this franchise, doing everything right to be approachable and playable in short bursts, at the cost of some kinda linear level designs. 

You can take your time to finish this game, and have some handy guidance as to what to do next, or you can complete this in a single session and fly through it once you know the ins and outs of the map. The gameplay is fantastic and the level design and story bits are great. The bosses are also quite the challenge!

### 19. Mario & Luigi Super Star Saga

This is another game I've not been able to fully complete. But I played it for 12 or so hours back then, and only stopped once I got stuck with a boss, I left it for a bit, and somehow my save file got lost in the void.

This is one of the games I'll pick back up once I have my Miyoo Mini Plus, or I could also play it on the Switch since I have NSO. Regardless, a unique JRPG with a unique gameplay style that keeps you in focus the whole time. Also a fun story with nice comedy bits.

### 18. Jeanne D'Arc

This is a tactics RPG for the PSP that was recommended to me a while back. It is a very fantastical take on Jeanne D'Arc's story. It was one of my first introductions to the genre---other than a couple levels of Advance Wars---and I definitely found it really engaging. I didn't really need much grinding, other than doing the extra stages once at least. 

The game features skill crafting, which makes it so even grinding has more benefits other than XP, since enemies drop their own skills to be combined with others, and the abilities you get from some are just amazing. It is a much better feature than skill trees, since pretty much every character can be tuned up to what you want it to be when it comes to magic and attack styles. Each character has their weapon and initial stats to be better at certain things of course, and the variety is great. Of course my favorite is the thief, who can wreak havoc, moving the most, evading everything and poisoning everyone!

### 17. Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade

### 16. The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap

This Zelda game is just awesome. It is a tight and doesn't take too long to beat. Every boss is great and it just looks wonderful. I wish the style used in this game was used in more games too.

Among 2D Zeldas, this is the one I have played to completion and even a bit more, collecting stuff and trying to unlock all the sword abilities and the likes. There are so many things to discover other than the main quest, and the traversal in the world is great, it is so colorful and fun, the sense of adventure is real on this one. Just a great game to pick up and play.

### 15. Ys Seven

This game is as Action RPG as it gets. It is one of the the highlights on the PSP and for good reason. I remember liking the story quite a bit, but its not the main reason to play this game, and I don't know how it compares to other games in the Ys franchise.

The plot revolves around the delicate balance of the world and things like that. There are neat extra sidequests to complete, and a lot of characters with different weapons and playstyles. You can also unlock new attacks that look and feel super awesome. The bosses on this game are really intense. It is not Monster Hunter, but it still feels epic and challenging. The final boss is a complete nightmare, but if you focus on unlocking and levelling up the right skills, you're good. I honestly had to look a guide just to know that, and I did my best to figure the patterns myself. Overall, a great journey to play through.

### 14. Celeste

I played this game when I found it for free during Christmas on Epic Games. Since then I also bought it on Switch, though I've not played it again just yet. This was a really right platformer with fantastic mechanics and tons of levels to complete. I really really enjoyed playing it and beating all of the main levels from start to finish in only a couple of days.

The game has some accesibility features for those who have a hard time with it, and it doesn't shame you for it at all. This is a nice touch that makes the game approachable for everyone, and there's tons of extra levels as well I might one day complete, whenever I play it on my Switch at last.

### 13. Ori and The Blind Forest

This was quite a surprise for me this year. A Metroidvania where you bring a forest back to its former glory, following quite a charming creature and jumping around in different areas. This game surprised me with its buttery-smooth gameplay and feel, as well as the wonderful level design and the simply incredible power-us, one of which is one if not the most satisfying platforming mechanics of all time.

The story is also rather good, told in a few lines of dialogue that make it feel almost like a fairy tale, it can be quite thought provoking at times as well. It is just a really well done piece of art.

### 12. Citizen Sleeper

This was a very neat modern role-playing indie game where you play as a Sleeper---a robotic body emulating someone's conscience---who escaped from the corporation that built them, trying to survive life day by day, making choices with limited time and energy to spare. It is a challenging future in a space station far away from everything. your choices lead to different events and different endings that can provide different outlooks on life both in the game and in the real world.

It was quite a unique experience, and I still owe it another replay to see more of it. And there's a sequel coming out as well, which is good.

### 11. Minecraft

What do I need to say about Minecraft that hasn't been said? This is one of the first proper computer games I played on a friend's laptop, I remember being happy with a house made out of wood, I remember that I had no idea what redstone even did. Later on I remember playing the free edition on an old Galaxy Tab 2 my dad had, and I also remember getting some patched version on my Galaxy S3 Mini back then.

Since then, I've bought the java edition on my Laptop and I play it from time to time, I manage a server for some friends and sometimes we reunite together and play once again. Will this game ever become irrelevant, I think it is destined to be rediscovered by generations to come. If only it wasn't controlled by Microsoft.

### 10. Ridge Racer

### 9. Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow

### 8. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown

### 7. Halo 3

The original trilogy of the Halo franchise is really something else. I am one of the few people who was fine watching my friends play, I had cousins who played CE on their laptop, I had a friend who played Halo 2 on their Xbox, and I was happy to watch it, because the game and the music were simply fantastic. Such a unique experience!

Halo 3 is one of the few games I've completed not by myself. This is a game that I completed in a single sitting, with some friends back in middle school, we stayed overnight and played through pretty much the whole campaign. It is one of my fondest memories in my life. To just play until 4 or 5 am, sleep, and wake up and complete it at last.

I really can't believe there was a time when I did that, but it happened, and since the game remains among the best in the FPS genre. Masterpiece.

### 6. Metroid Dread

Speaking of games that are a masterpiece of their genre, Metroid Dread dominates supreme with their latest entry in the franchise, and my favorite as well. This game is so fun to move with and has so many challenging boss battles and good puzzles to unlock new areas, this is the only game I've ever completed 100%, I just didn't want to leave it incomplete, especially since it was lended to me by a friend as well.

I really, really liked it. And I also love the fact that it takes so long to get the morph ball, it makes it feel so different to any of the classics, with its sliding mechanic and I can't help but love the animations all around. It is such a big flex from the developers, this game is a true accomplishment of game design, I want to be like it when I grow up.

### 5. Final Fantasy VI

The last of the 2D Final Fantasy games, and the best of them all---among the ones I've played at least---and it is absolutely wonderful. The art is good, the story is just incredible, the music is top notch, everything here is high quality.

Everything in this game is so well polished and I played it almost to completion. However, at one point my save file got lost to the void, and I will have to start it from scratch if I return to it. Once again, thanks to my Miyoo Mini Plus, the time might come sooner than expected, and I had already played a new save for a couple of hours on my PSP!

### 4. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

This is one of the first games I emulated myself in an old desktop computer with 512 MB of RAM running on Windows XP CIRCA 2012. It ran well enough for me. I recall that I played the first few areas, I managed to find the sword and the shield and got all the way to the boss in the Great Deku Tree, Queen Ghoma.

I couldn't do it, it was too scary for me and I did not dare open the game again, the creepy atmosphere and music were too much for kid me.

It wasn't until 2015 or 2016 that I just went back to it, and managed to complete the game! I even bought a PC controller, this time playing it on an old laptop I no longer have. It was a wonderful experience that I really have to relive soon, maybe on my Switch!

### 3. Monster Hunter Freedom Unite

This is one of the games I keep bringing up on this blog. I've talked a couple of times about playing this online with weird VPN programs and PPSSPP. Eventually better and more open tools, from OpenVPN to Zerotier or Tailscale emerged, and playing with other people is easier than ever.

The mechanics of this game are great, it is hard to think that it runs on a PSP, the controls are hard to get used to, especially the Claw if you play on real hardware, but pretty much the same controller scheme remains to this day. Whenever I play Monster Hunter Rise it kind of feels exactly the same, except for the extra buttons and extra attacks, but Freedom Unite is the escence of it all, and it comes with tons of content! Hundreds upon hundreds of hours of classic Monster Hunter at its peak.
