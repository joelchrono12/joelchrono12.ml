I gotta say, 2024 was quite a crazy year, I am now a proper adult with a degree and I will probably have to pay taxes for the first time in my life or something.

I am no longer studying, I do not have to do homework, I am not doing an internship in a field I didn't belong to. I have a job and I work from 8 to 5 from Monday to Friday and have a pretty chill life living with my family and making some decent money to save up and to buy nice things for me or the house once in a while, paying some "rent" to my parents, barely enough to compensate for having raised me at all, and such things.

I'm thankful for how 2024 has gone for me, it's been quite a mess worldwide, but at least in my small town somewhere in Mexico, I am pretty comfortable and happy to be alive.

Regardless, let's go through some of the more significant events that happened in 2024!

## Having a job at all

Honestly, the way I got my job so quickly after my internship is still surprising to me. Everything was setup for me to do yet another six months of internship, do yet another empty semester of University and maybe hope that in 4 or so months I could find a position. Instead, I managed to renew my internship, I managed to ask for a chance to apply to a position that opened up just a few days after my renewal begun, my own manager intervewed me, all my internship and workmates told me I actually impressed her, I did a couple more interviews and I landed the job! This happened in November of 2023 I know, but it wasn't until 3 months later that I passed the trial period just fine, and since then I've been doing quite well, some ups and downs, some times of stress and others to relax, it has been a nice journey so far, nothing too exciting goes on at work, but I have time to enjoy other things as well, and that's what matters to me.

## Completing so many things

I can't get over the fact that I completed 12 games and 15 books in the span of a year, that's something I wouldn't have thought possible even a year ago.

And of course I finished a couple of manga series too, although that's kinda easier for me. Anyway, even though I have a job now, I think the fact that I literally got nothing to do once I reach home is such a great feeling compared to the homework that was lingering on my mind after school, it's nice!

## Videogame acquisition frenzy

I wrote about this already, but I can't overstate how interesting just having the possibility to actually buy games has been for me, wether I should have done it or not it's not my point here, for 22 years of my life I never bought a game, I live in Mexico you know? most people here, especially young ones will simply get stuff via other means. 

After I got the Switch and got a few digital games I just, wanted to become a bit of a collector, I guess, that ended up becoming the case in the end, I have like 40 physical games at this point, and even if I haven't played 70% of them, there's something about it that makes me feel like "I made it." It happened before, with puzzle cubes, yoyos and with playing cards, but this is the first time where I didn't have to wait 3 months before I had enough money to get one or two things, you know? I went overboard, yeah, I have only bought 1 digital game this year so far, and I plan to complete more of my collection before I buy more.

## Graduating from uni, getting a degree.

I had my graduation event in February of 2024, I remember my boss being nice and telling me he would count it as home office instead of discounting a day from my vacations, it was a good event, quite bittersweet in a way, since quite a lot of my fellow engineers had already graduated, and a few others would not graduate yet. Despite it all, I still had plenty of known faces to celebrate with. I remember arriving early because my mom also graduated from University and had her event at that time.

Despite my parents telling me to rush, I really took my time to actually get my diploma, I had to do some paperworks, take some pictures and things like that, and it wasn't until like 3 or 4 months later when I finally decided to do all of that. And yes, I took another couple of months before I actually got a frame for it. I don't know why I took that long when it isn't even something complicated, procrastination is quite something.

## WeBlogPoMo2024 and Writing Month

Two different writing events happend throughout the year, during May, I wrote a bunch of different blog posts, and it happened similarly in November. Despite my best efforts, I didn't manage to actually write daily on either case, which was quite surprising. Still having two challenges to write often was nice, and it was even better that I managed to write consistently the whole year, at least 4 or more posts per month, that's a new record for me!

## Miyoo Mini Plus and RG35XXSP

These two consoles were present for half of the year, since I got them I have been obsessed with retro handhelds, and tempted to buy more and more. Everything started when I got a Miyoo Mini Plus from AliExpress. I fell in love with the console, and it's probably the only reason I didn't post every day during WeBlogPoMo2024 that I can remember. The SP was a childhood dream come true, and so far I've managed to resist the urge to get something else.

Now that the switch 2 is coming soon, I might end up getting it!

## A dog's passing

Chicharito was my first dog, he had been with us for 14 years at this point, and he passed away in September after an unfortunate accident. I remember dealing with it at the time, and some memories are coming up now that I write about it. I had a big draft
