You may be able to tell---since my favorite videogame is Chrono Trigger--that I am quite fond of JRPGs. This genre has been interesting to me because they usually provide really good stories, as well as a good amount of fun and interesting mechanics. Turn based combat is what I usually play, since it lets me take my time every battle and try to make good choices.
