The Legend of Persia is a videogame series with quite a lot of history, and I am not too familiar with it. I have seen gameplay and screenshots of the first one, but never played it myself, same for the 3D games, but I know they have some similarities with today's Assasin's Creed, another series I haven't really played, except for spin-off for the PSP---which was quite great I must say. And there's the Sands of Time movie, which I can't really remember.

So, that's all I knew about the series when I decided to pick up this game. Honestly, the only reason I even cared about it was because it showed up in my favorite gaming podcast [Into The Aether](https://intothecast.online) and that they said it was an early GOTY contender, and a Metroidvania. That's what got me.

A Metroidvania game! Once again! this year I finished [Ori and the Blind Forest](/blog/ori-and-the-blind-forest), as well as [Metroid Fusion](/blog/metroid-fusion) and [Metroid Zero Mission](/blog/metroid-zero-mission). It is a genre I really really like, and seeing all the price I decided to buy it. All of this happened in May, 2024. Yeah. I really took my time for this one...



TL;DR: the game is _amazing_, a wonderful blend of exploration, combat and platforming, to traverse the lost cities of Mount Qaf, filled with secrets to find, enemies to defeat, and paths to uncover.

The story itself is nothing too special, you are Sargon, part of a group of warriors called the Immortals, and your mission is to save the Prince of Persia, who has been kidnapped and taken hostage inside Mount Qaf, a mythological region frozen in time, filled with mysteries and dangers. There's a couple of plot twists, and by the end you have to save reality itself, or something like that. It has some good moments and great concepts, but the writing is not the best and lots of seemingly important things or possibilities just never develop further.

It is rather convoluted and disconnected plot, things happen just because they do, there's random new characters that show up once and never again, or multiple times for no real reason. If you are looking for a solid story that will leave you wanting to know what is going to happen next, this really ain't it. 


One of the defining traits of this game when compared to old and new games in the genre, is its quality of life features for backtracking and traversal. This game has a few amazing innovation---and a couple of weird caveats---with plenty of save points and teleport stations, making traversal really easy, there's a feature to teleport between save points later on, making backtracking a breeze. 



The addition of Memory Shards, an item to literally take a screenshot of your location and pin it on the map, is an incredible feature that I will miss in other Metroidvania games from now on. However, the game lacks a mini-map for literally no reason, and I found myself constantly opening up the full map, which is at least really snappy and quick to do.

The game takes place in Mount Qaf, a place where the flow of time is different from the outside world. We find a lot of different environments and they are all super different and varied. Most areas are quite recognizable too and distinguisable from each other, making exploration really enjoyable and worthwhile.

There is a lot of mythology and lore to find which is actually kind of interesting, related to myths and legends of Persian culture, I don't know how much of it is taken from real life and how much is just part of the game's worldbuilding, but it was still nice to collect and read some of the scrolls, poems and dialogues.

The game let's you customize your play style with different amulets you can put on your necklace. They offer you different skills that will change the way you play, for example there's an amulet to increase your attack damage, or to increase defense, or to refill your magic quicker, or to have extra combos and attacks, among many others.

One of the definite highlights of the game is the combat, the game has a parry system, a great moveset revolving around sword fighting, and lots of movility options to position yourself exactly where you want to be, create opportunities for combos, and deal with multiple enemies at once.

Unlike in _Metroid Dread_ and, _Samus Returns_, _The Lost Crown's_ parry system is not a must, but it is rather useful, and even more with medals if you focused your build on it. I was not the best doing it, it wasn't as easy as Metroid's but also not as essential. I could do it 6 out of 10 times and it was always satisfying to land on regular enemies and of course bosses. There's a few other weapons in your arsenal, used for combat and puzzle mechanics, which I won't mention to not spoil the fun.

The boss fights are comparable to those of Metroid Dread, with difficult bosses with multiple attack patterns to learn and master. They are all quite challenging and many of their attacks were hard to read. As a fan of Monster Hunter, getting to learn the behaviour and attacks that enemies do is pretty important, this is not a game where you can just smash buttons at random, the parry mechanics during boss fights are also pretty awesome, being quite risky but rewarding if done well. I also appreciate the minimal amount of quick time events, there are some inital button presses to start a few action sequences but they are very forgiving and don't detract from the experience.

## Sound

However, the dub work is really well done, having a Persian dub is very welcome as well, I used it for half the game and I really enjoyed it.
