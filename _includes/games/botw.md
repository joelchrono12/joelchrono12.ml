Zelda Breath of the Wild

Breath of The Wild is one of those games that you can't just ignore, at the time it came out, it seemed like the peak of gaming, in handheld form, and I was eager to play it some day.

When I finally decided to buy a Switch, a friend let me borrow his copy of BOTW to test it out. I've enjoyed it thoroughly since then. The exploration, the vibes, the environment and the wonder, everything is still there. A world to explore and get lost into.
