- **‚úâÔ∏è [Email](mailto:joel.chrono@disroot.org)** - I started using email more often now, you can send me an ecrypted email using my public PGP Key, download it [here](/pgp), I would appreciate if you use said encryption.
- **[XMPP]()** - This is more of a protocol that can be used with different clients. It's more minimal and easier to self-host than Matrix. Clients like [Conversations](https://conversations.im/) or [Blabber.im](https://blabber.im/) provide encryption via [OMEMO](https://conversations.im/omemo/), This is a great way to contact me quickly since Matrix notifications are less reliable for me.
