- **üêò [Mastodon](/mastodon)** - This is my main social media of choice, I post often and I am quite active too. You are probably already following me, but if you arent, make sure to do so!
- **‚úâÔ∏è [Email](mailto:joel.chrono@disroot.org)** - I started using email more often now, you can send me an ecrypted email using my public PGP Key, download it [here](/pgp), I would appreciate if you use said encryption.
- **[XMPP](xmpp:chrono76@chat.sum7.eu)** - This is more of a protocol that can be used with different clients. It's more minimal and easier to self-host than Matrix. Clients like [Conversations](https://conversations.im/) or [Blabber.im](https://blabber.im/) provide encryption via [OMEMO](https://conversations.im/omemo/), This is a great way to contact me quickly since Matrix notifications are less reliable for me.

- **üïπ [Itch.io](htps://joelchrono12.itch.io/)** - This is my itch page. Itch.io its a website used to host games and game jams. You can access all of my games, which are not masterpieces, but still a bit of fun. Follow me there if you are interested in following updates and releases of my game projects.
- **üõ© [Telegram](https://t.me/joelchrono12)** -If you want to have a chat with me, this is where I am at. It is not the most private messaging service in the world, I know, but it still has a lot of features, and you can contact me without having to share phone numbers.
- **üíª [GitHub](https://github.com/joelchrono12)** - Here you can check out some of my projects, there are not a lot, but I still would love to try stuff out and contribute however I can. I have done a lot of icons for the Arcticons icon pack.
