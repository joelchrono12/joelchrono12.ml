I really love the way trends can take shape when it comes to Mastodon. There is no algorithm that shapes your view of a topic, and the local timeline is quite a lively community, at least on Fosstodon and similar places.

So, when my [post of my analog watch](https://fosstodon.org/@joel/109005194088466959) got so many replies and boosts from people across the fediverse, I got quite excited, among the many photos sharing their watches and collections, a reply with a picture showcasing the classic Casio F-91W showed up, and then another, and another, and another, until even [Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) (and probably some others) ended up getting one, and now I am tempted myself. Its super cheap, so I'll probably get it soon enough, [~~or maybe you can buy me one you know?~~](https://joelchrono12.xyz/paypal) (I have to give this a shot ðŸ¤£).


The way it works is funny, sometimes you just happened to get boosted by the right people at the right time, other times you are just famous enough by yourself, I have close to 800 people who follow me after all for some reason, I guess I am a bit of a Mastodon *influencer* ðŸ˜Ž. You never really know to be honest, this blogpost may not get much interaction despite it all.

Regardless, every now and then I see more and more posts of people who got their Casio watch, or already had it collecting dust and decided to use it again, its kinda fun. Kev made a [post about his recent purchase](https://kevquirk.com/the-casio-f-91w-is-the-best-smartwatch/) (and I think he got another Casio watch now lol), some other poeple interacted there, a couple [other blogposts](https://ruario.flounder.online/gemlog/2022-09-26_nostalgia_and_technology.gmi) showed up as well,and now I felt like writing all of this.

At this point the trend took a life of its own and most people don't know where it comes from, and that's perfectly fine. It was about time Casio watches had some love around this place. I don't know how long will it last, maybe a "Casiodon" instance is in the horizon, or maybe next week nobody will post their watches anymore. Such is the nature of the Fediverse, and I am happy to be part of this little corner of the Internet.

Sidenote, I've been quite busy on school, there were not a lot of posts this month so I hope I can make up for it in October, or maybe not, lets see how it goes...
