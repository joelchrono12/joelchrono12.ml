As a professional hobby collector, one of my favorite things has always been learning the best way to do a certain thing, but something I like even more, is learning the cool way to do a certain thing. 

Learning how to do them is always kind of handy, depending on the situation. So, I've decided to do a short list of things that vary from actually useful, to kinda fun and impressive looking! I know how to do all these, and it makes life a bit more fun everytime!

- [**Ian Knot**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O-xaJrao1w): This is the fastest way to tie shoe laces, **an absolute must** compared to the other skills mentioned here, this is a real life changer that I have used *for years*, I truly think I've saved at least a couple hours of my life because of the seconds I save up from using this method. 
- [**Riffle shuffle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ZD1lDbW3M): shuffling cards properly, without the need of a table or knee to support the deck, just using the hands and proper technique, is genuinely fun and impressive when done smoothly!
- **Rubik's cube fingertricks**: I am not talking about solving a Rubik's cube---although you should still learn how to do it---but learning how to turn it using finger moves instead of grabbing and twisting it like a maniac is honestly kinda fun even if you don't know how to solve it, learn a couple of cube patterns too and you'll be able to fool some people, until they grab it from your hands and shuffle it beyond repair.
- [**Deck flip**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFIf1ZC1lY4): This is nothing but a way to turn whatever you hold that is around the size of a deck of cards into a fidget toy. I do this with my phone, post-it blocks, my ID card holder and many other things, a must learn!
- **Touch Typing**: Learn to type with all of your fingers---or at least nine of them like me since my right thumb refuses to cooperate. Probably the one that takes the longest to master, but totally worth it.
- **Folding clothes**: There's plenty of different ways to fold different clothes, and looking online for them is kinda fun, some are super fast to do, others are rather compact, just check out some videos out there!

There are many other little skills like pen spins and other flourishes that I think are pretty neat too, but these are the ones I like the most and I do quite often. What about you? What are some other cool things you think I should learn? Contact me and let me know!
