It is the month of May already, and this is the first time I went for an entire 30 days without doing any blogging here. It is a little disappointing, but its also not that big of a deal.

I just had some free time during Eastern which were quite relaxing. I don't know if I'll write everything I did but you can get an idea out of this summary.

# Podcasts

I listened to a total of 82 hours of podcasts, I would say a fair bit of that was while I slept, since I tend to leave them playing for a while with a sleep timer.

- __Into The Aether__: took over again with around 19 hours of playtime, I have to say I don't particularly remember much this time.
- __Welcome to Night Vale__: I think this one is a fairly popular podcast, and I have listened to it before, since its so unique and weird I kinda listened to it before goin to sleep pretty often during April, a total of 9 hours.
- __Unexplained__: Season 6, Episode 12, a three parter that got quite a bit of my attention. I listened to a few other episodes but that one was while I was fully awake. 6.3 hours.
- __Breakers__: I listened to the last episodes of the first season and it was quite a thrilling listen, I recommend this one, its about people trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world and I kinda love it. Its a single host doing all the voices, but he pulls it off. 5.8 hours.
- __Sweet Bobby__: A short series about a pretty peculiar catfishing case, some find it quite ridiculous and consider the victim super gullible, others admire the lenghts the catfisher went to keep the facade going for a decade, I found it entertaining.

Other podcasts that got at least 3 hours of playtime were Retro Game Time Machine, Self-Hosted, Escape Pod, Trash Taste and Destination Linux.

# Books

- __Eisenhorn: Xenos__: I didn't really keep going with First and Only, a novel from the Warhammer 40K universe I started, this one, however, from the same author, hooked me pretty hard, it is a long story, but I have read up to chapter 21 from the book out of 27. The hype and stakes are pretty cool, its not like what I usually think about when I think of Warhammer, this story is not about Space Marines or epic space battles. This is about an inquisitor, who gets rid of heretics, xenos and mutants, and it is a bit of a detective story unraveling a pretty big conspiracy against the Empire, heresy indeed. Give it a read honestly, its pretty good, I will finish it soon enough, although chapters are getting a bit longer lately.

# Anime

- __Gurren Lagann__: I heard this one was some people's favorite anime, so I decided to give it a watch, right now I am at episode 9, and I kinda like how its going. It is a Mecha anime with big robot fights and quite an interesting world to explore, the plot is interesting and characters are a bit of a mixed bag, however I am interested on what's going on and the stakes and hype is real.

- __Dead Mount Death Play__: I don't know much about this one, I went pretty much blind, its a fantasy manga that starts out with the Demonlord and the Hero's final encounter, after an incredibly well animated fight scene, the villain casts a spell that ends up breaking the barrier between dimensions, and clashing with the real world as we know it (reverse Isekai stuff but don't skip it because of that). I don't want to say much more, it seems really, really interesting.

# Manga

- __One Outs__: As I said, after watching the anime I have read some of the manga, but I still don't reach the point where the anime stops, still, its fun to see the story being told in this medium.

- __Heavenly Delusion__: I had started this one a while ago, I am not sure why I stopped reading it, I realized an anime came out this season, so I decided to keep reading it a bit rather than watching it, even though I have heard a ton of good things about it.

- __Kingdom__: I am still up to date on this one, some heavy stuff is happening right now, you better start this one already before it reaches 800 chapters!

# Movies

- __The Super Mario Bros Movie__: Really fun for everyone, I had a blast watching it, not a masterpiece by any means but a nice time nonetheless. Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches, Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches, ooooooh I love you.

# Gaming

Like last month, gaming took over a bit of my life again, I kept playing Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, Freedom Unite and I also played quite a bit of Minecraft on some my personal server and other SMPs

# Device Usage


I used my computer quite a lot less compared to last month, with a total of 135 hours of screen time.

## Desktop

Also, the browser extension for ActivityWatch recently got accepted on the Firefox Add-on store again, so I managed to record a couple of stats from it.

- Firefox was used for 74 hours
    - Youtube was used for 27 hours
    - Twitch was used for 2 hours
- PPSSPP was used for 14 hours
- Godot Engine was used for 9 hours
- Minecraft was played for 8 hours

## Phone

I used my phone for a total of 199 hours, this was quite a lot more than previous times, oops.

- Newpipe, used for 75 hours
- YouTube, used for 14 hours
- WhatsApp, used for 13 hours
- Librera, used for 12 hours
- Bromite, used for 9 hours
- Infinity for Reddit, used for 8 hours
- Tusky, used for 5 hours
- Tachiyomi, used for 4 hours

# Finishing up

I actually got an internship now, I took my time huh, I will probably be unable to blog as often, but maybe since my time will now be shorter, I will actually decided to write quick blogposts instead of playing videogames for 3 hours straight, I recently started watching some videos from the QSMP, a minecraft series featuring creators speaking Spanish, English and now Protuguese, it is pretty fun so far. Until later guys!
