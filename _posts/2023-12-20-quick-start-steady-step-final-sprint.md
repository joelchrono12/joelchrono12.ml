As the year comes to an end, I have to rush on these posts! So I hope you don't mind having some shorter reads.

Today, I just wanted to point out what a weird year this has been for me when it comes to writing posts constantly throughout the year.

Just take a look at the numbers:

- January: 31 posts
- February: 10 posts
- March: 3 posts
- April: 1 post
- May: 1 post
- June: 1 post
- July: 5 posts
- August: 3 posts
- September: 7 posts
- October: 14 posts
- November: 6 posts
- December: +7 posts

I barely managed to stay afloat thanks to the epic feat of doing a third of the progress in one twelfth of the time.

In February there were only 10 posts, which was still more than 9 out of 12 months in the year. Then I went by doing a single post for 3 months, then half of what I did in February in July, I dropped again in August and I finally managed to go up a bit more during September, with October keeping the ship afloat. From there on its remained somewhat steady, although still short from the ideal of 8 blogposts per month

But I wouldn't say I lost hope at any point of the challenge until now. Seeing how I could post daily or even twice a day if I really wanted to, so, embrace yourselvesâ€”it's happening now.

# The competition

I am now in the final sprint alongside other great bloggers like [Clayton Errington](https://claytonerrington.com), [Garrit Franke](https://garrit.xyz) and [Brian Bennet](https://blog.ohheybrian.com) and of course [Noisy Deadlines](https://noisydeadlines.net/)! I am ashamed to say [Hyde](https://lazybea.rs/) managed to beat me this time around. But I have to mention this is his [fourth time beating the challenge](https://lazybea.rs/posts/100daystooffload-round4/), so we'll see how it goes in the future! If he decides to join once again...

Finally, I wouldn't blame you if you missed it because of how quick this guy did it, but [Fredrik Bjoreman](https://www.bjoreman.com/) actually completed the challenge twice this year. Now that's what I call crazy fast.

This is day 90 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
