Do you see my logo up there? if you don't, it's probably because you're reading this from your RSS Reader... anyway, if you visit my website, you'll see my logo and since you are qutie clever, you'll be able to know it's just the initials for "joel chrono," my username, duh! But why does the C looks like like that? and what does "chrono" mean anyway? Well, it's actually ~~a complete rip-off~~ a reference, to one of the most influential works of interactive media in my life.

In March 11th, 1995, a videogame would come out, that would change the course of history as we know it...

*Chrono Trigger*.

Created by an assembly of the best people in the field, Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of *Final Fantasy*, Yuji Horii, creator of *Dragon Quest*, and Akira Toriyama, creator of the *Dragon Ball* franchise. These individuals would be known as *The Dream Team* from then on, and with the music from the talented Yasunori Mitsuda and Nobuo Uematsu, and the work of many other passionate artists, they would go on to make what I consider to be, the best videogame of all time.

Thirty years have passed, and there's been countless attempts to bring the magic of *Chrono Trigger* back, from fan efforts in the form of the---[sadly cancelled](https://web.archive.org/web/20060507142747/http://www.opcoder.com/projects/chrono/)---*Chrono Resurrection[^1]* project, the sequel known as *Chrono Cross* that deviated in such a radical way it became its own thing---although it does have its own merits---the Tokyo RPG Factory projects such as *I am Setsuna* or *Lost Sphear*, and the many indie project like *Sea of Stars* and *Chained Echoes* that have come the closest to reaching the heights of its inspiration. But after all these years, nothing is like going back to the original.

I played this game for the first time in 2016 I think, I was looking for random games for the SNES to play on my PSP, my emulator handheld back in the day. I saw Chrono Trigger in many lists, and I have to admit I was a little skeptical, but I decided to give it a go, and from then on, everything changed...

The art, the music, the gameplay mechanics, the story and characters, everything comes together in a magnificent way! I can't help but love it.

However, this is not a review---I want to replay one more time before I fully commit to writing one---I am just happy to have played this game and I'm excited for some of the news about what Square Enix is planning to [celebrate its anniversary!](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/chrono-trigger-to-celebrate-30th-anniversary-with-various-projects) A Nintendo Switch release? An HD-2D remake? A full 3D reimagining? A sequel? Whatever it is, I am looking forward to it!

This is day 35 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)

[^1]: This project is really so interesting, there is an alternate reality out there that got to enjoy this, and it's simply incredible, here's [an interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20060421042601/http://www.chronocompendium.com/Stories/28) I found that was quite amusing as well.
