This month has been great, I got a Nintendo Switch and I love it, some of my usage of stuff changed things so, here we go!

# Podcasts

The usual suspects, Trash Taste, Welcome to Night Vale, Late Night Linux and Dungeons and Daddies.

The only new stuff would be **[Talk Ville](https://www.talkvillepodcast.com)**, a podcast hosted by Tom Weiling (Clark Kent) and Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) rewatching Smallville, it is quite fun and nostalgic, very good stuff and its nice to see their thoughts on what they did 20 years ago.

# Anime & Animated Shows

- **The Spectacular Spider-Man**: After watching Across the Spiderverse I felt a bit weird about not really liking the Spectacular Spider-Man, purely because of its design and style, slightly too cartoonish for my taste, so I decided to watch the show once and for all and I ended up LOVING it. I finished it super quickly and was utterly disgusted by its lack of a proper ending, I really wanted to see Gwen and Peter's relationship grow too, such a missed opportunity.
- **My Adventures with Superman**: This is another look into Superman's origin story and his relationship with Lois Lane and their internship at The Daily Planet, the animation is pretty good and the story is everything you already know, but told in a slightly different way, very interesting, I also really like the Superman emblem redesign.
- **Spy X Family**: Still watching season 2 with my siblings, super wholesome and fun, very good.

# Manga

A lot of manga was read last month.

- **Frieren: Beyond Journey's End**: This is a MUST read. The Hero Party of a fantasy world has finally defeated the Demon King, and everything is peaceful once again for centuries to come. The heroes are now legends, but their mage, an elf named Frieren, remains alive, while his human companions grow to old age. The keeps going and 80 years later he embarks on a new journey. Absolutely fantastic story.
- **Spider-Man: Fake Red**: What happens when a regular teen finds Spider-Man's suit in the trash, and ends up being forced to wear it and try his best to keep the city safe? This is a great story, that tackles what it means to be Spider-Man and has some great characters and a very unique story. Good stuff, sad its not very long, like Spectacular Spiderman...
- **Weak Hero**: I got into this lately once again, fun teen action drama stuff with school gangs and corruption, I already mentioned it before, nice street fights and stuff, its kinda addicting.
- **Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou**: This is the most nostalgic, relaxing and melancholic, yet hopeful manga I've read, I had already mentioned it before but it really deserves a chance, if you are only into action and stuff, calm down and give this a thoughtful read, its worth it.
- **Kingdom**: A new arc has begun, some political drama is coming and I am here for it. Kingdom is great so please just read it, its 700+ chapters will fly by, I promise!

# Movies

- **Ratatouille**: Do I really need to say anything? This movie is fantastic, a joy to watch. It had been a few years since I last saw it, it felt quite refreshing, and I can't believe I was barly 7 when it came out.
- **X-Men**: My younger sister started watching some of the old-gen superhero movies and I sat to watch this one too, surprisingly entertaining and it also holds up quite well, I love the effects on this one, except for the frog one, he is too goofy.
- **X-Men: The Last Stand**: I missed the second one so, yeah. But this one was also fun enough, I can tell why it got badly received and all that but I kinda wish they hadn't left us with such a cliff-hanger.
- **Honest Thief**: Liam Neeson is yet again doing Taken, your typical fun action thriller for everyone to enjoy. Nothing too original but entertaining.

# Games

- **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild**: This game is a masterpiece, I've been playing it for 30 hours or more and I feel like I still have a ton of stuff to learn, pretty cool stuff.
- **Metroid Dread**: I love Metroid, and this is some of the best gameplay and new mechanics on the series and the whole genre, fun and action packed, I've only played for like 2 hours though.

# Device Usage

## Laptop

I only used my computer for 30 hours this month. I must be very good at keeping myself in control right?

Truth is, I got a Nintendo Switch! the Tears of The Kingdom edition, as you may have noticed in the Gaming section...

- I used Firefox 21 hours
- Alacritty for 3 hours
- Minecraft for 2 hours
- PPSSPP for 1 hour

## Phone

I used my phone for a total of 205 hours, so yeah...

- Newpipe for 31 hours
- Tusky for 30 hours, yey!
- Facebook for 25 hours, booo
- Tachiyomi for 23 hours, yey!
- WhatsApp for 20 hours, booo
- Aniyomi for 15 hours, yey!
- Fennec for 10 hours, meh.


# Final thoughts

Alright, so yeah, the Nintendo Switch is great and Zelda is awesome, I don't know what else to say, read the manga I suggested, play videogames, send me your Nintendo friend ID and lets play Rocket League or whatever.
