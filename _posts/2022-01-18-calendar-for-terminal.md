I was checking out my email today using neomutt, which I've been trying for a few days, and I stumbled upon some people I've talked to that are part of the Fosstodon or the Fediverse in general.

From there, I went ahead and checked out some posts and blogs written by them in my RSS reader, and I stumbled upon and article by Hyde (aka Lazybear) titled [Calendars and Terminal](https://lazybear.io/posts/calendars-and-terminals/), which really got my attention. It talks about `khal` and `vdirsyncer`, a couple of tools that can be used to access my calendars from any CalDAV server, such as my Nextcloud instance, right from my terminal.

I ended up trying it out, and it wasn't half bad! I basically just followed his tutorial, but I also found a similar post by Hund which shows also [how to manage and sync contacts](https://hund.tty1.se/2020/08/12/how-to-sync-and-manage-your-caldav-and-carddav-via-the-terminal.html) with the same tool.

I haven't really done the contacts syncing yet, but I might as well try and set it up soon.

I don't really want this blog to turn into yet another tutorial, so please, if you want to try this out check the couple of links I shared here.

A cool thing that vdirsync has is support for `pass`, or any other command to get your password without just storing it in plain text, so that's pretty cool, you can check my rather simple config in [my dotfiles](https://tildegit.org/chrono/dotfiles)

Now I have added my school schedule, since I just started a new semester, and my time is not as much as before. So, this has been day 87 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
