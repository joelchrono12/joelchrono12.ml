If you are reading this from an RSS feed you may not notice the amount of changes my website has gone through in the past couple of weeks.

A series of events happened that somehow made me think *I really should dedicate a bunch of time to modifiying my website structure once again*.

I am *not quite sure* of what exactly triggered me to do this, but there are many things that made me keep going at it until today. Among them is sickness, and boredom and---Yep, pretty much that.

Last month I was [PenPals with Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/penpals/joel-chrono) and we exchanged quite a few emails, there I mentioned wanting to make my site more colorful and the like. I didn't go that far just yet, but since Kev preferred a light mode, as well as many others, I decided to add one for my site.

I had a light theme months (maybe more than a year) ago, back when I was just using [SimpleCSS](https://simplecss.org/) with some colors changed and minimal changes. At some point---probably just to save some bytes of data or some random reason---I decided to get rid of the light colors and left the site with my dark Tokyo-Night based color theme. Regardless, it is back now for those who may need it! I am not the biggest fan of it, but it works well enough now---I think.

Another change that I made quite recently was trying to go for a more semantic use of HTML. I usually used `<div>` elements whenever I wanted not much, but more than I actually needed. This time I decided to go for a more proper approach. Still making use of them when necessary, but not as much as before. Thanks to Jekyll, just by modifying the base layouts I already had 99% of the work done, and only a some pages had to be changed by hand.

I created some new bits to make my site a bit flashier too, thanks to [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) I modified my [homepage](/), my [blogroll](/more/blogroll) and my [booklog](/more/booklog) to fit more content and have it wrap nicely.

Finally, inspired by the site [Noisy Deadlines](https://noisydeadlines.net/), I also went ahead to something I used to have before, which is a Monospace font! My personal choice this time around is IBM Plex Mono, its been a favorite of mine for quite a while and I quite love its *italics.*

Anyway, feel free to look around the site, I also added some breadcrumbs to the top section, right under the header, a move inspired by [Benjamin Hollon](https://benjaminhollon.com/)'s site, that has gone through some changes as well recently!

Sorry for the delay between posts, as I've mentioned, I was a bit sick, and I am still a little bit. So, I am delayed with my writing, with work and also some commissions from my Ko-Fi page, so if you requested one from me, please have patience, I'll get to it as soon as I can!

This is day 21 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
