This week I asked for a few days of vacation and I catched up with some friends I hadn't seen in ages, so it was very different, here's some notes about it.

- 💻 I only worked two days this week before my vacation time, they were a couple of relatively uneventful days, but there was actually a lot of stuff going on waiting for me once I got back. My workmate got my back though and things haven't been that bad since my return today.
- 🛋 I went on vacation and stayed in a hotel with a group of friends. It was nice to actually have some days to rest for once, no family appointments or anything like that.
- 🫂 Connecting again with my friends was honestly the highlight of my week. I hadn't seem them in ages, it was a pretty awesome time, catching up, sharing how is life now that some of us have jobs, remembering how we met and the like while having dinner, such a wonderful time.
- 🃏 I showed my friends how to play *Oh Hell* and *Egyptian Ratscrew*, they were a complete success! We also played *Spoons* and I played *Spit* with one of them a couple times.
- 🎲 Another friend had a dice game called *Qwixx* and it was pretty fun! It's like Bingo but with a bit more strategy and decision making on it, might get it soon.
- 🎾 I also played some sports! I tried Tennis for the first time! The hotel let us borrow some rackets to play a bit. I also played a few soccer matches, even managed to score a couple goals, and did some basketball too, but I'm worse at that one. It worked well to replace going to the gym this week!
- 🏸 After the vacation time we still went out on Sunday to a *quinta*---there were some baptisms at my church. After the service we played some *Exploding Kittens*, and Badminton too! 
- 💭 On a kinda serious note, this week, I thought a lot more seriously about the kind of person I wish to marry, and the kind of man I hope to become for them. Kinda strange but, well, yeah.

## 📖 Reading

- **Cibola Burn** - read until chapter 9, still going at it, even though I didn't read it as much as I could, because gaming and vacation time.
- **Usogui** - read until chapter 25, still pretty interesting and high stakes, it's just a pretty fun read where tension rises after every page. Cool stuff.

## 🕹 Gaming

- **Hollow Knight** remained strong even during my vacation time! I had a few hours of rest that wasn't spent on outdoor activities or social interaction, so yeah, I managed to progress quite a bit! I am currently exploring *Deepnest*.
- **Hades** is great! I finally managed to defeat Hades himself once, so I've made some nice progress in the story and I have been doing a couple more runs as well. I let one of my friends try his luck and he had quite a bit of fun playing it, but I left him wanting more.
- **Astro Boy: Omega Factor** got played less than an hour this week, it happens sometimes.
- **Super Mario 3D World** is my current choice for couch multiplayer gaming, it just works, and it's super fast to get it started too.
