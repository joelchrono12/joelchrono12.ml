This blogpost was inspired by the title alone of [this post](https://barfooz.xyz/how-time-flies) I saw on my RSS reader, this isn't a response, I wrote it before reading the actual content of that page so, yeah. I'll read it after I'm done with mine and maybe do a reply to that in the end if I feel the need to.

I have been thinking about how quick time is going.

My work is quite enjoyable. I've been at it for a year and a half now, and I wouldn't say I'm bored or dissapointed. Some days I am, but it's not a day to day thought. I have gained some great experience getting to know how things work in the manufacturing industry. From engineering, to production, to logistics. It's been quite nice that my position lets me glimpse at the possibilities and multiple fields in such a way.

Over time, work has a rhythm to it. I guess I did expect it, but it still hit me when I realized how quickly time just passes by without me realizing it.

I don't know why or how, but there's a difference to when I was in school to now, even if both have a certain routine.

In university, we had different schedules every semester. New teachers and courses to take. Everyday we had a different class, and we would get used to that routine for a bit. Some day would have multiple courses in a row, with only a lunch break in between. Other days would be just a couple of courses separated by a lot of free time. Another day would be a single, but long class to take.

Then the lockdown happened. University continued but it wasn't the same, I only chose a few courses to take, hoping to be able to take more courses once we got back to the classroom in a few months---*we didn't*. At least I learned a lot about other things with my free time. I got into game dev, anime, Linux, and the Fediverse. A routine at home slowly developed.

When I did my [social service](/blog/a-normal-day-of-social-service/) things would change again. Those were pretty repetitive days, we would just design a couple of graphics a couple times a week, record a video or so when some event happened. Most of the time we would just sit on the office, lend devices, cables or adaptors to teachers and students in the computer lab, simple tasks that left me with a lot of free time. I remember reading quite a bit of books back then, and doing **a lot** of origami, like, actually a lot, so much the office was completely decorated by horses and butterflies by the time I left.

That time went by rather quickly, and we would constantly chat with my fellow classmates doing their service too. I formed a couple of not-so-close but nice friendships and we had a routine. Not everyon was studying mechatronics like me, some were in law, others in biochemistry and such. Getting to know them was fun. 

One of the ways I kept myself entertained was installing Tailscale on the desktop computer, just to get access to my FreshRSS instance from there, I spent a lot of time reading, I kind of wish I had done week notes, or at least link blogs sharing what I found interesting during those times.

Doing social service during vacation time was the ultimate cheat code, literally nothing happened, we just chilled in the office, filled our hours and were done with it.

Some days I was just quiet, once the conversation died down. I'm not naturally talkative, I won't start a conversation in person unless prompted, unlike online, where I randomly look for some blogger's contact info and say hi lol.

A few months later some classmates finished their social service, and having to get used to new people, now we were the experienced ones, showing them how things were done.

Those last few weeks with new people were a bit of a nightmare, some were way too extroverted for me, and would interrupt conversations to talk about something else I didn't care much for. They were from the same class so there was a bit of a division.

Just remembered, that all of this was happening during the aftermath of the covid lockdown, we were all masked up! I actually forgot that, I didn't saw some of their faces for ages because of the masks. To think that hit me even more now. Time does indeed pass.

And then I was done, and now it was time to look around for an internship opportunity. But of course, I just begun a pretty regular semester, and ended up doing that instead.

Sidenote: *Wow there are a lot of timeskips here I am sorry for the stream of random thoughts.*

Eventually I had to actually find where to do my internship. I was super lazy, I didn't look that much, I didn't ask, I really wonder why I took so long to actually find one, it should've been easy, looking back.

It wasn't until a friend send me some contact info and I actually decided to call. It went well! Except that it was an internship in HR recruiting. Miles away from my Mechatronics Engineering degree. But well, I did that.

I would walk for hours, or sit for hours, giving away fliers, or interviewing candidates for basic worker positions. I went to some pretty ugly neighborhoods, street dogs, abandoned houses, graffiti, that kind of stuff. To people who can't really find many job opportunities besides those offered by us and similar companies looking for cheap manual labor.

Yeah, kind of dystopian to be honest. But after everyday goes like that, I just kind of got used to it. I understoond a bit more about society, how the poor struggle so much, without studies, or an actual decent house, and yet they keep going day after day.

I would prefer to think I helped at least some people get a first-step to change their lives for better, but it takes a lot of effort and, well, I don't know, I prefer to remain optimistic.

Time flies again, I finally landed a job. And here I am.

It still took some time for school to setup the graduation, go to the event with my family, rent a hood/robe (la toga in Spanish) to wear. And then suddently, months went by and I finally finished the paperwork to get the actual degree. Then, months happen again, and I do more paperwork to get my professional id, and it's done.

Every week, flies, it's monday, then it's friday, and everything in between is a blur now.

The thing I like the most, is that there's no homework now, I can genuinely not worry about work after my time is done. Except that I get a phone call or two sometimes, that's annoying, but it's miles better than what others deal with.

And well, now I'm 25. The covid lockdown happened, social service happened, my internship happened, university is over, I have my degree and all the paperwork, I have a job and now what?

I do feel a bit stuck sometimes, but I just get over it, I can play videogames, weirdly more than when I was at school (again, no homework to worry about!), I read and do other tasks, watch movies, I can afford to do stuff I like, and to buy the things I want. I am single and live with my parents, my university was super cheap, I have no debts or economical issues at all.

Life is good, but I feel like it's flying by too quickly. I keep feeling like I should save more, so I can afford more, have a relationship, a family, a place to call my own. If the people I recruited as an intern had managed to form a decent life, all things considered, I should be able to get started too. I don't want to oversimplify things of course, everyone has issues to work through.

I guess it's just that I don't feel like an adult yet, should I go date already or just wait some more? I don't think I'll ever be completely ready for a relationship, or whatever is the next step of my life. Maybe I'll leave my current job to switch things up, even if everything is working out just fine? I have coworkers here doing the same thing for almost a decade, why do I feel that can't I do the same? I am still young enough and have enough money saved up to be able to risk it, it might be fun, but I probably won't do it anyway. Having a regular life is perfectly alright. I just wish it didn't go so fast.

## A response!

Well, after all of that I read the actual post I linked to in the beginning, with the title of the post it could only end up in a similar way, although maybe not as nostalgic, or melancholic.

It was a good post! A nice catch up on how life has been going for the author, who is much more ahead than me in terms of life experiences it seems. I want a robot lawn mower too...
