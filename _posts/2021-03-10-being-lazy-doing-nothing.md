The last few days, I realized my physical shape is not the greatest. My life is not too healthy, I am not obese nor too skinny or anything, but I know I could be better. I decided I wanted to do some biking and exercise a bit, and since my bicycle was in need of reparations, I needed to move.

# A lot of walking (and a bit of biking!)

Yesterday I went downtown. The workshop is like 15 minutes walking from my house. But I actually used my bike most of the way, since its only problem is that I cant change the gears, so it works, but it feels extremely light, which is good when going uphill, but you don't get a lot of power out of each pedal (is that the right verb? *my Spanish speaking mind is confused*).

Anyways, once there, I only had to pay 105 pesos (around 6 USD) to get the needed parts and their installation, I felt like it was *extremely* cheap even for Mexican standards, I wonder how much it would cost in other countries.

However, I had to walk back to my house, since I only had 100 pesos with me (oof), the good thing is, I am actually pretty used to walking, and I enjoy it quite a lot. So I came back home while listening some Daft Punk (RIP), took the money and went back since the bike would be ready in 30 minutes (basically I arrived at the right time!).

So yeah, I went back home with a pretty epic fixed bicycle. It felt quite nice, because it had been a while since I tried a functional bike, and it was a lot of fun.

# The next day... (~~Today~~)

I had quite a lot of homework, but I really kinda wanted to go out and bike for a little bit. However, distractions, procrastination, *YouTube* and a bunch of excuses where clouding my mind. And I ended up doing absolutely nothing worthy of being called "work". I started doing some homework, but I didn't even finish it. I started getting my bike ready, but I didn't go out and used it. I even started the first Uni class of the day, and the teacher didn't even taught us anything!.

# It wasn't so bad after all

At the end of the day, at least I managed to do a couple of nice things. I finished my other class *Analysis and Design of Mechanisms*, which was actually extremely nice and I would say I learned a lot. And I did most of one of the homework I had to deliver this week! (I still have some more tho, sadly).

However, I know I can do better, tomorrow I will try and do some proper biking, as well as finishing most (if not all) of my homework. I feel so bad about what I didn't do today, because I know homework is easy, but I struggle to get started. And biking is great, yet I made excuses not to go out. 

Well, this felt like some kind of journal, but its my blog, I do whatever. This was day 24 of [#100DaystoOffload](https:/100daystooffload.com)
