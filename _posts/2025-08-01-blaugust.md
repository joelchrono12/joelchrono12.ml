For some reason, even though I've been blogging since 2021, I've always missed this event.

[I already completed](/blog/400-days-to-offload) [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) this year, so I thought I may as well participate on something else that gives me another excuse to ~~use a trendy hashtag~~ interact with the community a little bit more.

Blaugust is a month long blogging event where the goal is to write 31 blog posts! It's similar to [WeblogPoMo](https://weblogpomo.club) or [Writing Month](https://writingmonth.org), and there are some [weekly prompts](https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/25/blaugust-2025-calendar-weekly-prompts/) you can follow if you need ideas.

I am pretty good at just coming up with my own themes, but I like some of the suggested ones, so I may use them in the upcoming weeks. Pretty much everyone is welcome to take part on this, so, this is your chance! share me your post if you are worried nobody will read it, because I definitely will.

As I'm trying to cutdown on my social media usage, I won't be joining the Discord server, but I'll send emails and replies when inspired by the posts being written, and I'll still share my own to social media (albeit via a shell script using [toot](https://toot.bezdomni.net)) whenever they happen, with the appropiate hashtags. Of course, if you want me to see any replies related to them, you would be better off contacting me directly.

So far, I've seen these people participating, and I'm sure there's a list somewhere with more:

- [Jedda](https://notes.jeddacp.com/blaugust-2025-round-2)
- [Marisabel](https://marisabel.nl/public/blog/Blaugust_2025_:_Introduction)
- [David](https://forkingmad.blog/blaugust-2025-is-here)
- [Sam](https://thetangent.space/2025/welcome)
- [Alex](https://wrywriter.ca/posts/blaugust) 

I just rememberedremembered that I can follow [the hashtag](https://mastodon.social/tags/blaugust2025.rss) via RSS so I don't need to open Mastodon or anything! Feeds for the win!
