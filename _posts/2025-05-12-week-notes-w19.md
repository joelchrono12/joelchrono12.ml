# Weeknotes W19

- 👩‍👦 Happy Mother's Day! We got a couple of clothes for her, and of course, some nice flowers too. My dad took her for lunch at a fancy place and left us behind 😭
- 📽️ After the shopping spree, we went to the movies and watched *Thunderbolts*, I had heard that it was actually good, and I agree with that sentiment. It was nice to see civilians being saved for once. Really good stuff.
- 📱 Unfortunately, my phone's power button started acting up again, so the device bootloops endlessly until I press and hold it for a bit. This hardware issue doesn't happen often but it's annoying and worrisome. I already have a Xiaomi Mi 12T Pro, but I don't like HyperOS. It'll have to do, while I decide between a Nothing CMF 2 Pro or a Pixel 9a---feel free to let me know of any suggestions.
- 🌐 Skype is gone. I thought about writing something about it, but it wasn't really that big of a deal for me. If anything I'm annoyed because Microsoft replaced *Windows Live Messenger*---which I actualy used quite a bit---with Skype more than a decade ago. However, the one friend I had on Skype introduced me to Daft Punk back when Get Lucky was on the radio everywhere, so I am grateful for that. I stopped using it early on though. RIP.
- 🎒 I have been watching *Weak Hero* on Netflix, a kdrama about kids in school who got involved with some gang doing plenty of crimes, and they are trying to dismantle their operation. It's based on a manhwa which I actually really like. The way the plot develops in this is so different, I don't know if I like it, but I definitely enjoy the fight scenes.
- 🧪 I watched all of the fourth season of *Dr. Stone* and well, it was actually great! I really enjoyed the way the story progressed, and how there's a battle between two scientists. Just turn off your brain for a bit and have fun! I love these characters so much, solving every problem with the power of science!
- 🃏 I didn't play with the Nintendo Switch at all this week. During the weekend we played some [Snap](https://www.pagat.com/war/snap.html) instead, and it got really really fun! Once only two players remained, they played War, and the winner got a bag of snacks!


## 📖 Reading

- **The Space Merchants** - Finished! This book ended up going in a very different direction, and I honestly enjoyed the journey quite a bit. [My review is up!](/blog/the-space-merchants/)
- **How To Grill Our Love** - Read up to chapter 70. I recommended this rom-com to a friend and ended up reading some more chapters of it, it's still very wholesome and I really like it!
- **DanDaDan** - Read up to chapter 188. There's a new menace and people with powers now working for some evil plot. This is still pretty bonkers and quite fun!

## 🕹️ Gaming

- **Ys: The Oath in Felghana** - I hadn't played this game since March. Last time I played I had gotten stuck at a miniboss in the final dungeon. As soon as I returned today, I defeated it first try! I have been exploring a new area of the dungeon and getting progress done.
- **Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow** - I beat one optional boss and I've been exploring the castle, in a new area I got access to, thanks to a new power-up.
- **Ultimate Chicken Horse** - Played a a couple of matches with friends and had a great time. I hadn't played this one in ages, at least not as seriously as this time.

People auto-delete posts, migrate instances, or just close their accounts and everything goes poof. Only ghosts remain in some cached posts and the like. Dane is a bit melancholic about it.
