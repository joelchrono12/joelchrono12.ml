This week saw was full of gaming and reading! Things were much more balanced though, because I spent some time writing blog posts and doing actual work. Sill didn't read as much as I wanted.

* Ô∏è‚ô†Ô∏è I'm back in the game, my itch for card magic has officially returned, I've watched way too many magic acts and practiced quite a bit of techniques I almost forgot about, it's been very entertaining.
* üÉè I finally introduced [*Oh Hell!*](https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html) to my friend group, and had a blast playing it! The rules were quite relaxed at first, since I wasn't sure of what to do in some situations, it got smoother in the end and very exciting.
* üéµ [I unsubbed from Spotify](/blog/bye-spotify-(for-good)), but I deleted YT Music too, I'm still subscribed to YouTube Premium but I'm using the FOSS client [RiMusic](https://rimusic.xyz/).
* üëü I bought new shoes for my family and me, it's been a while since we went out and spent money so, I was pretty happy to oblige. We even managed to convince my dad to finally buy a pair of Vans shoes, which he usually doesn't prefer.
* üò∑I did not go to the gym during the whole week, I was sick and I never felt like going, I admit I got lazy too in the end, will return tomorrow.
* üé• We watched *Mickey-17*, a sci-fi dark comedy film about a guy who becomes an "expendable", a human that can be regrown over and over again after he dies, keeping all his memories intact. He's used for deadly experiments and dangerous missions. After an accident, they end up regrowing him despite the previous Mickey surviving, which leads to some complications. The premise was interesting but it had a weird tone to it, and I am not used to black humor at all, should've checked the rating beforehand, but my sister wanted to see it because of Robert Pattinson. I liked the idea, not the execution.

## Reading

* **Cibola Burns** - Read the prologue, part 4 of *The Expanse*, a favorite character makes a return, I am already loving it.
* **The Space Merchanges** - Read up to chapter 5, this book is getting interesting, it is quite satirical in a weird way, I still enjoy it though.
* **Hunter x Hunter** - Read up to chapter 353, not a lot of progress compared to previous weeks, but there are more speech bubbles than before.

## Gaming

* **Dicey Dungeons** - I beat up to episode 4 of the Warrior dice, and made a couple attempts of episode 2 of the Thief, still trying to make progress with others as well.
* **Hollow Knight** - First time playing it in 2025, don't know why I abandoned it so long, but I picked up the pace and managed to find a way forward, since I was a bit lost last time.
* **Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition** - I started this on a whim, I've played 4 hours and it's already incredible, I might get Chronicles X after all, but I'll hold off for now, probably return to DQXI.
* **Astro Boy: Omega Factor** - Somehow got hooked on this properly, with a very interesting plot twist that has kept me playing for a bit, will keep at it to see where it goes.
* **One Step from Eden** - I played one more session, this game might not be it for me, no story at all is such a bummer, getting good at it is not worth it just for the sake of it, might still do a few more runs though.
* **Faster Than Light** - Started a new run, got a bit unlucky and ended up died sooner than expected, still, it's fun, even without a very deep story, at least I can roleplay it in my head.
