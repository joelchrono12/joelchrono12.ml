This is the third book of the Expanse, and after so many blog posts queued up, I forgot to review it for the site!

I quite liked this one, like Caliban's War, it introduced many new characters and perspectives, building up on the Expanse's universe in quite a lot of ways.

From here on out, I don't know if I can review these books spoiler-free, they connect to each other so much, I think I could ruin the whole thing if I'm not careful with what I say. However, I'll try.

The story is about a gigantic ring of alien origin in space, for reasons explained in the previous books. The ring is being monitored by the different factions of Humanity, and, after a certain thing happens, we discover it's actually a gate, that leads to some unknown location. For reasons explored in the book, James Holden and his crew decide to---or are forced to---fly there, and there are many more ships that want to study or see what's up. However, unexpected things start to happen, and everything turns to chaos.

The new characters of this book were a bit of a mixed bag for me, I found some of the perspectives to be more exciting than others, however, in the end all the characters were quite great. Everything was a roller coaster, I just wanted to keep on reading page after page. It has some ups and downs, but when those moments come, when the science fiction, the action, the cosmic dread and everything form the perfect mix, it was simply _fantastic_.

This book also does have one of the best mind bending cosmical revelation moments I've read in a while, so if you like that kind of trippy stuff, it's here! 

I will say, this was the first time where I actually felt like some things were too convenient. I know it's sci-fi and everything can happen, but I am not talking about Deus Ex Machinas, it's just some of the choices made by characters, or some of the lucky moments they go through and the like. It did not ruin the fun most of the time, but I found it a little weird.

Other than that though, Abaddon's Gate delivers! Great space opera, I will read the next one in January.
