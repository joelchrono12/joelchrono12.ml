So, a few days ago my Raspberry Pi died because of a power outage, most likely, the SD card got corrupted *again*.

I really, really should just look for some way to stop that from happening.

Anyway, my contact synchronization is no more, my FreshRSS instance is no more, my Nextcloud instance is no more, and I have to find alternatives in the mean time.

I think that I will for sure switch to an SSD next time I try to boot it up, I already have one that I just haven't installed and should help me avoid these issues. these issues. Right now my Pi is just sitting there collecting dust, I actually bought a new mini hdmi dongle to try and boot it with a monitor and keyboard plugged in.

For a bit I even thought of going back to Google, but I am not that lazy. I will probablyl just trust [Disroot](https://disroot.org) enough to hold my contact and calendar info, and maybe the [ZDX free FreshRSS instance](https://rss.zdx.fr) to be my RSS backend.

Thankfully, all of the pictures I had on Nextcloud is on an external drive I was using as just storage on my Raspberry Pi, so I can still get that out. I could probably just keep using it as just a hard drive and use it whenever I need. I remember using MEGA at some point for my cloud storage needs, I should maybe go back to that? I dont' know.

Everything would be solved if I just had some external power source that kept my Pi alive during outages, and a script that shut it down safely...
