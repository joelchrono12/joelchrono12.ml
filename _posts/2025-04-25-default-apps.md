It's been a couple of years since I've updated my [default apps list](https://defaults.rknight.me), so I thought I may as well do it. My previous list is [still available](/blog/default-apps-2023) if you want to check it out as well! See my [uses page](/uses) for more.

One of the notable changes is the lack of any Nextcloud services. My Raspberry Pi is still not online, and I haven't really missed it that much. Most of my file management is now done on my computer with local files, and I sync stuff with Syncthing to my phone.

Other changes would be browsers, the removal of Simple Apps in favor on the Fossify forks, and a couple new sections I saw some people add, like blogging and social media.
