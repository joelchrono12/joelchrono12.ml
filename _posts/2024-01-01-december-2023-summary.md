December was packed with a lot of things I managed to do, Christmas happened, a New Year is upon us, and here is what I did in the mean time.

Thankfully, I got some vacation time, which allowed me to do do quite a lot, from listening to more podcasts while cleaning up my room, to playing a bunch more videogames, while watching movies too. Regardless, too many things to list, but I will still try.


## Podcasts

- **Into The Aether**: This lowkey videogame podcast was about to upload its GOTY episode, an Epic, with a duration of 6 hours. I could've finished a videogame while listening to it, and I am sad that I didn't. I listen to some previous episodes just to catch up a bit too.
- **Retro Game Time Machine**: This podcast is just cozy and I keep listening to it quite a bit, but I didn't listen to their GOTY episode just yet, which is only 2 hours long or so.
- **Stuff You Should Know**: During one of my free days I started listening to this podcast while cleaning up my room and it just picked some random episode, all of them were incredibly interesting topics that I should indeed know!
- **Ars Paradoxica**: An audio drama that keeps on giving, I only listened to 3 or so episodes this month, but it was good.
- **Dungeons and Daddies**: Just keeping up with the show, going good, give it a listen!

## Movies

I also watched quite a bit of movies this time around, and I also made sure to log them on Letterboxd. Here's some of them

- **A Quiet Place**: For some reason we picked this movie as the last movie of the year, and we finished it in 2024! The most iconic scene (which I wont spoil but you know if you know) actually happened right when the New Year started!
- **Spider-Man: No Way Home**: We watched this movie together, and it actually ended at 11:00 pm, I wished we had started it an hour later, because it is a more wholesome movie to end the year with than A Quiet Place.
- **Home Alone**: Classic movie of the season that is still very funny.
- **Home Alone 2**: Classic movie of the season that is still very funny.
- **Midnight**: A Korean thriller that follows a deaf woman threathened by a psycho killer. Quite a terrifying plot, not going to lie, tons of suspense. I originally wanted to just play on my Switch but it was just too good to miss.
- **Spider-Man 2**: Classic movie that remains as one of the best examples of what a Superhero movie should be about, a complete masterpiece.

## Videogames

As I mentioned in a previous blogpost, I started to record the playing times of games I own, which should give me quite a bit more data to add here too. For now, let's start as always.
- **Citizen Sleeper**: I finished this game mid-December, it was a great, short story-driven RPG with a unique style and characters, I wrote a full review [here](/blog/citizen-sleeper/).
- **Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga**: I got this game to play in couch co-op with my sibling and it is indeed quite fun!
- **Hades**: A fantastic roguelike too, with a pretty great story, which I've played quite a few runs of. I am quite fond of its gameplay and mechanics, but I can't help but feel like my best runs are a result of luck and level-ups rather than actually improving my combat skills.
- **Spelunky**: This is a roguelike I tried recently, and it is really fun! The gameplay is easy to understand, but it is quite challenging and merciless.
- **Ember Knights**: This is another roguelike with similar combat to Hades but it also features couch co-op gameplay, we actually got quite far one time where I was playing with two other friends, and we did quite a bunch of attempts.
- **Limbo**: A very special platformer with a unique atmosphere and great puzzles and mechanics, this is just a must play that everyone should try.
- **Ori and The Blind Forest**: This is a Metroidvania style game that features a beautiful artstyle and wonderful animations, I am playing it at my own pace, it got great platforming but I am not a fan of its combat at all. Still, I'll keep playing and see what I get.
- **Hyper Light Drifter**: This is a top-down action adventure game, kinda like Zelda, with incredible pixel art and challenging combat, it even has couch co-op mode. I am liking it a lot, but I haven't advanced much.
- **Final Fantasy IV**: I decided to continue my adventure on this game on my PSP, I almost manage to escape from the Sealed Cave!
- **Ninja Five-0**: This is a small arcade platformer game where I am a ninja fighting crime, the gameplay is surprisingly entertaining and the controls feel quite good.

## Manga

I read quite a bit of manga this month, right after I did my blog on my favorites of the year, one of these also became a favorite of mine.

- **Monster**: This manga took me by surprise, I was going to watch the anime, but I just wanted to go a little bit faster and decided to read it instead. This story is truly phenomenal. Its about a doctor who is betrayed by his own morality, involved in a series of murders that lead to him being the main suspect. I can't tell you much more, just go and read it already.
- **Fly Me To The Moon**: I read quite a bit more of this manga, and got to some really interesting chapters that go beyond what normal slice of life stuff goes, I think it is worth checking out, plus it has a lot of sugar in it too.
- **Weak Hero**: I finished this manhua, and what an ending. I didn't think a school nerd against the bullies story would work and develop like this one did. The art is great, and so is the plot and the fantastic characters, give it a read, there's a reason it was in my [favorites of the year](/blog/my-favorite-manga-of-2023/).
- **Survival**: This also made it to the list of favorites, for good reason. A kid survives in the post-apocalyptic wilderness where 90% of the planet is now under-seas. This is his journey, read it.

## Books

- **Ender's Game**: Because of the amount of other things I did, I only read bits and pieces of this book during some free time and commutes. I am still liking it a lot and I've read 60% of the story so far.

## Device Usage

This list doesn't really track my Nintendo Switch usage of course, which was quite high during my holiday vacations. Regardless, I would say the amount of games I listed is enough of an idea, so here's the rest of devices I used!

### Laptop Usage

I used my laptop for a total of 75 hours, and here's some of what I did!

- Firefox: 49 hours
- Alacritty: 13 hours
- Discord: 5 hours
- Inkscape: 5 hours
- Steam: 1 hour

### Android Usage

I used my phone for a total of 174 hours, thanks to the vacational period I guess.

- YouTube: 43 hours
- Tachiyomi: 20 hours
- WhatsApp: 15 hours
- Cromite: 14 hours
- Discord: 11 hours
- Facebook 9 hours

## Afterwords

So, yeah, December was quite a busy month right? Remember you can always follow my [backloggd](https://backloggd.com/u/joelchrono) to check the games I've played!

I feel a little weird right now, I just finished the challenge, but with so many people participating this year, I may as well do it one more time...

This is day 1, of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
