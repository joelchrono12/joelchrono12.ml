As of the time of writing, I have driven a total of 807 miles---1298 kilometers for regular people---which basically means I have managed to beat all of the 9 Basic Tours and 4 Pro Tours, from class 1 to class 5! That's a lot of drifting!

So yeah, **the PSP is back!**

This all started because [Brendon](https://mastodon.social/@brendonbigley) and [Stephen](https://bsky.app/profile/stephenhilger.bsky.social) from the [Into The Aether](https//intothecast.online) podcast, announced that they are making a PSP premiere episode this season, which means they'll play a bunch of games for the PSP and talk about it for I hope 5 or more hours straight.

Of course, [I am](/blog/what-is-on-my-psp/), and [have always been](/blog/my-psp-is-back-in-shape/), *a PSP sicko.*

I already mentioned this multiple times in [previous weeknotes](/blog/2025-w02-weeknotes/#gaming) but I felt like talking about it on its own post, that's how excited I am to just have my favorite podcast highlight one of, if not __the most significant gaming device of my life.__

All of these things also made me return to my journey playing _Final Fantasy IV The Complete Collection_, and to dip my feet _once again_ into the Ys franchise with _Ys: The Oath of Felghana_. Both have provided me with a lot of fun as well, as mentioned before.

I am even considering to purchase some physical UMDs, because _why not?_ But I don't actually want to do that right now, I am yet to purchase a physical game this year, keeping with [the commitment I started last year!](/blog/games-to-beat-before-buying-more/)

Regardless, it is a little ironic, to come back to the PSP over my current emulation handheld, [the Anbernic SP](/blog/the-gba-experience-i-wanted/)---where I'm playing games like _Drill Dozer_ or _Fire Emblem_---or my Nintendo Switch---where I have done a lot of progress lately with _Dragon Quest XI_ and _Hollow Knight_. 

The PSP should not feel as good as it does when compared to the nice things of modern software and hardware, and yet, **it does**. The XMB interface remains _absolutely **gorgeous**_, and the hardware itself is still really nice!

The only real issue is the buttons for me, only because I replaced the originals after they broke when I shell-swapped my device, and the 3rd party ones are still quite stiff, my thumb gets actually tired of pressing them sometimes, not a good thing when spamming sword attacks in _Oath of Felghana_. But I'm still playing!

What else can I say? the hype got to me, and [the hobby cycle](/blog/the-hobby-cycle) never stops going.

This is day 10 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
