Oops, sorry for the delay this time, anyway, here are the things of note that I consumed this month! Had a bunch of things going on and I also did a bit of commisions and things, I am actually behind schedule so, oof.

## Books

- [Out Of The Silent Planet](/blog/out-of-the-silent-planet) by C. S. Lewis. I finished this book and I was quite fond of it. I am eager to read the sequel, but I also want to try a lot of different books this year, so we'll see.

## Movies

- __Howl's Moving Castle__: This was a nice Ghibli movie I wanted to watch for a while, it was a pretty great movie with awesome animation.
- __Concrete Utopia__: A korean movie I watched at the cinema and I found it quite entertaining. Post-apocalyptic world where a single apartments building remains standing and society around it tries to survive.

## Podcasts

- __The Vergecast__: Listened to quite a bit of episodes about OpenAI, Apple Vision Pro and other recent things going on.
- __Pretending to be People__: I listened to a few episodes of this Real Time Roleplay podcast, which does not use D&D mechanics and is kind of interesting! Murder case story.
- __SCP: Find Us Alive__: This is a radio transmission from an SCP base stuck in a pocket dimension. Super interesting sci-fi audio show.
- __Radio Rental__: Just real life stories of bizarre events and weird things that happened to people, with a fantastic presentation, maybe a meta-narrative? Still need to listen more.
- __The Ten Minute Bible Hour__: I listened to a bunch of episodes, studying Matthew still. Interesting stuff and points of view regarding the Scriptures.
- __Relatos de la Noche__: Just horror stories I somehow sleep to before sleep, in Spanish, good stuff, the host has a nice voice to sleep to.

## Manga

- __Monster__: Read chapters 77 to 96
- __Kingdom__: Read chapters 776 to 782
- __Sakamoto Days__: I only read one chapter

## Anime
- __Solo Leveling__: I started watching this anime based on one of the first manhuas I ever read, so far, so good! But I haven't catched up to it. Should give Frieren a watch...

## Videogames

- __Balatro__: New roguelike poker game. Insanely addicting, actually great, epic, a must.
- __Yoshi's Island__: A classic platformer that holds up really really well to this day.
- __Lumines__: Super addicting game I've mentioned before.
- __The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild__: I managed to beat another Ganon and unlocked Mipha's healing ability. Did some shrines.
