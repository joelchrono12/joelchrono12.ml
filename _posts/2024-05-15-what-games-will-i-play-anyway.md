This is a summary of the games I am planning to tackle first on my Miyoo Mini Plus, some of them are new, others I have played, some I will continue, others I will start from scratch!

The first one is _Mario and Luigi: Super Star Saga_ for the GBA, this was one of the first games I tested and it made me fall in love with the system, it looks so good, colorful and crisp. I had a savefile with 25 minutes or so and I decided to just keep going on it. The moments have been fun so far and the battle system remains as fun as ever! The fact that I have vague memories of what to do helps me speed the process quite a bit, which makes the whole thing a breeze as of now, I'm making steady progress thus far and I hope to finish it very soon.

Another gem of the GBA, is _Advance Wars_, a tactics RPG that has been on the top of my Play Activity for a while now. The game is pure strategy and I am going through all of the tutorial stages as of now, I only need to do another 5 levels or so, but it is incredibly fun and addictive. I really wish there was an _Into The Breach_ demake for the GBA though.

_Final Fantasy VII_ is another I plan to continue on the device. Last time I played it on my PSP, it got stuck during a cutscene, and I couldn't get past it in any way, so I ended up just not playing the game. I also bought the Switch version that comes bundled with FFVIII, but a friend of mine borrowed it, and I think I'll be fine completing the game here.

_Suikoden II_ is a game I played for 9 hours or so on my PSP, and I plan to continue playing it as well! The game looks incredible, I really wish there were more games on the PS1 with such wonderful 2D graphics combined with 3D and high-res effects, it holds up perfectly to this day. I am also playing a patched version that has some nice QoL features and bugfixes, I hadn't experienced any to be honest, but it doesn't hurt to have it.

Another games I want to resume are _Parasite Eve_, _Xenogears_, _Metroid Zero Mission_, _Fire Emblem_, and Pokemon, be it Crystal, Emerald or whatever. And of course, start another run of _Chrono Trigger_, because I have to, it is my duty!

From then on, my plan is not really set yet. I think I've put a little too much choice in my hands now. I have been playing _Apotris_, a Tetris clone that has a really clean interface and playstyle, which makes it perfect for the MM+, I think I'll look for a demake of _Lumines_ as well, to have a couple of more puzzle games to play around.

Now, when it comes to games I've never played, there are quite a lot! _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_ seems like something I have to give a go to, there's also _Koudelka_, a very rare survival horror JRPG game of which I saw some reviews and moments, I was surprised by its superb voice acting and direction, although its combat seemed average, I still want to play through that story. _Soul Reaver: Legacy of Kain_ is a game I remember seeing a friend play as a kid, and I was amazed by it, I really want to give it a go, and the same goes for the _MediEvil_ games.

I also really want to play _Mother 2_ (Earthbound) and _Mother 3_, _Bahamut Lagoon_, _Trials of Mana_, the _Golden Sun_ duology, _Vagrant Story_, _Aconcagua_ and many others!

Let's just say there are quite a few entries I need to add to my [backgloggd profile](https://www.backloggd.com/u/joelchrono/)...
