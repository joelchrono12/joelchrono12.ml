Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

December was fun! I had vacation time, the first time I've been on vacation since I started working, it has been pretty fun! I went to visit my family in Veracruz, in a small town there where my grandparents on my dad's side used to live. I visited aunts, uncles, cousins and such, I had a great time.

Besides everything mentioned here, I also played quite a bit of tabletop games, such as Mexican Train, Exploding Kittens, Uno and the like.


## Podcasts

This month was pretty similar to November, mostly listening while asleep and such so, yeah...

- __Welcome to Night Vale__ for 20.2 hours. Sleep lots of random episodes, good stuff.
- __Retro Game Time Machine__ for 10.3 hours. I have to admit I don't even remember which episodes of this I listened to, oops.
- __Into The Aether__ for 9.3 hours. Apparently the new Indiana Jones game is insanely good, aldo Dragon Quest III is the only game tempting me to buy it, I will probably fall for it.
- __Dungeons and Daddies__ for 5.6 hours. The story is getting fun again now that a new character showed up and is so chaotic and fun I love this.
- __Trash Taste__ for 4.9 hours. Their episode rambling on tabletops games with ProZD was absolutely fun!
- __Late Night Linux Family__ for 4.8 hours. Just the regular news and events and developer linuxy things.
- __NPC: Next Portable Console__ for 4.4 hours. Listening to Brandon and friends talking about handhelds is always fun, there's something about the audio that is really bothering me though, like white noise or something.
## Manga
Lots of manga was read this month, it was really nice to have during my vacation trip.

- __Death Note__: I completed this manga in a matter of days, it is a very interesting story where we follow Light Yagami, as he finds a notebook that will kill any person whose name's written in it. Yagami is an ace student and intends to bring justice and rid the world of evil, until L, the greatest detective, decides to find the culprit of these mysterious murders. This was a fantastic read! I understand why it was so popular back in the day, kinda want to watch the anime next. I also read all the official short stories.
- __Jujutsu Kaisen__: I read lots of JJK this time, up to chapter 224, the action is great but I really think that a lot of things are happening just for the sake of the plot without much justification, some things are explained afterwards but its been a little hard to follow. Still, the action rocks!
- __DanDaDan__: I am still reading this and I caught up to the manga, its very fun and some crazy stuff is happening. I keep enjoying it a lot.
- __Frieren Beyond Journey's End__: I also caught up to this, I just love these characters, and the stakes of the adventure are quite good, it's thrilling, I want to keep reading!
- __Kingdom__: The new arc is evolving quite nicely, there's been a bunch of politics and non-action sequences that I still enjoy, and it looks like war is upon us soon enough as well, epic.
- __Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou__: I read a couple of chapters of it this month, always enjoyable and nostalgic somehow, I will keep reading this at my own pace, monthly mayhaps.

## Movies

- __Gladiator 2__: We went to the movies to watch this one and I kinda liked it, it was a nice movie to eat popcorn to. We went to a really fancy cinema that was twice as expensive as normal, I don't know why, but we could still afford it so it wasn't that bad, besides, the seats were super comfortable, and the popcorn was really good. The movie was OK.

## Gaming
Since I decided to complete 5 games before I buy one, I've been working hard at it to finish some games soon!

- __Hollow Knight__: I made a lot of progress in this game already, playing it for around 15 hours, I have enjoyed it a lot. It is quite the challenge but I still really like the atmosphere and the gameplay quite a bit.
- __Hades__: This game as proved to be much more fun than I thought this last two months compared to when I started it early in the year, I really should have given it a proper chance to evolve more and play it more consistently, hopefully I beat it once this month.
- __I Was a Teenage Exocolonist__: I keep dropping this game for long times and then playing it for 3 hours straight, I really think I'll finish it this month though, hopefully.
- __Super Smash Bros Ultimate__: The usual party fighting game I play every sunday with friends, what's not to love?
- __Super Mario Bros Wonder__: I played this solo for a bit throughout the month, really fun platforming, may finish it by March if I don't forget to play it or something else shows up.
- __Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury__: I've not played it since the last time I mentioned it weeks ago, but I played it this month, so here it is.
- __Fire Emblem: The Blazing Sword__: I played like 10 hours of this game this month, it is absolutely amazing, although I admit I have made a lot of use of save states, since I don't want my characters to die.
- __Final Fantasy VI__: I finally returned to this game for a little bit, I also watched a [15-hour long playthrough](https://youtu.be/WNnN4K2lSTU) of it that literally ended where I stopped playing, so that's fun.

## Books
My goal this year was 12 books, and I somehow managed to finish 3 in December, making for a total of 15!
- __[Caliban's War](/blog/calibans-war)__: Fantastic continuation for the series, I will read the next one now that the new year has begun! Not much more needs to be said, I really enjoyed it, the world building keeps being top notch!
- __[Farewell Earth's Bliss](/blog/farewell-earths-bliss)__: A dark, bleak future where humans colonize Mars by sending criminals sentenced to live in isolation in the red planet, where a society of convicts has developed. An interesting work with no optimism to be found.
- __[Roadside Picnic](/blog/roadside-picnic)__: An amazing take where aliens came to Earth, and then left without further to do, abandoning a bunch of junk and scrap behind, technology beyond human comprehension. The characters move the story forward on this one, a simply fantastic read.

## Finishing thoughts

Oh right, and this shall be day 1, of the fourth run of [#100DaysToOffload!](https://100daystooffload)
