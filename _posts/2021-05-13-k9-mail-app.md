As mentioned in previous blogs, I recently switched my android rom and factory
reset my device. In the process of doing so, my email app of choice broke, that
app is [Spark Email](https://sparkmailapp.com), a proprietary app that I
simply liked because of its pretty UI and ease of use. Despite that, I
was felling a bit ashamed of using it, because, well, *it's not FOSS*.

I am quite a FOSS advocate, but I am also a bit pragmatic. I still use
Google services often, a lot more than I would like to admit. So if I was
already using them, why wouldnt I give away more of my freedom for the sake
of convenience, right? 

Yeah, that's the train of thought I have sometimes. But other times, like
today, I am feeling a more privacy conscious, and I decided to look for an
alternative email client. I had already tried
[Fairemail](https://email.faircode.eu/) a *fairly* decent app that works
wonderfully. However, it contains unobtrusive, privacy friendly  ads, which
are not bad at all and are completely understandable, but I didn't want to
deal with them, besides, I had already tried it, and I wanted something
new.

And here is where [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app) comes to the rescue. The
app was a bit dead, but last year, the app got a visual redesign that
caught my attention and convinced me to give it a chance. I knew about the
app for years, but just by looking at its icon and the screenshots
showcased on F-Droid, I never installed it.

## Setting up my accounts

I was pleasantly surprised, setting up my Gmail account was as simple as 
Google lets you, using the so called "App Passwords" needed for anything 
that doesn't wanna use their login authentication methods.

Adding the rest of my accounts was a piece of cake, I had to add my school
account with IMAP because the domain was weird and unable to be
automatically setup like my personal one, however, it was no big deal.

A Microsoft account I got had no trouble at all, although I should add 2FA
to it, since it's not active.

## The User experience

K-9 Mail pretty much looks like the Gmail app before they changed to
Material Design 2.0 a couple years ago. And that's a good thing for me. It
has a bit of similarity to Fairemail, but I liked K-9 a bit more since its more
simplistic and a bit less cluttered. Besides, the starting screen of
Fairemail its their settings, and its really overwhelming, which was a
reason I wanted to avoid K-9, since I thought it would be even worse. But I
am quite happy with how it is.

There is a really good Dark Theme, a nice amount of settings and
customization and it even applies a dark mode to the email contents, which
is good for those nasty non-plain text emails that have their own styling.

# Overall

It is a pretty great experience! so nice and comfy I did a whole blog about
it. Like, I can't believe I spent so many years not using this (being fair,
it looked terrible 2 years ago, but still).

The only thing I disliked for a bit was the non-instant arrival of emails,
which is normal for most email clients that once again don't depend on
Google immediately. I wonder if there is some way to trigger the update,
but at the same time, I don't really need email to be instant.

With this setup, I am very happy again with my FOSS mindset. It has
reinspired me to check out even more alternative, free software
applications. This is day 36 of
