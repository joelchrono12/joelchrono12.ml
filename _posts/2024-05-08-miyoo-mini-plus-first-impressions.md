My Miyoo Mini Plus is here and I already love it. Here are some bullet points:

- The buttons feel good, the screen looks great, the speaker is much better than I expected.
- Installing OnionOS was a breeze, setting up the emulators was fine, transferring my ROMs from my PSP was simple.
- Getting SSH working was fun, using SSHFS to access it all from my computer was awesome to see, although it was a little slow.
- Transferring save files was alright, I had to delete the save states generated by Miyoo Mini Plus automagically for them to be recognized, or maybe figure out how to reset a ROM is better.
- The GBA save file format of the PSP emulator I used is .sav, the mGBA's format used by Miyoo Mini Plus is .srm, but there are online converters so it wasn't that painful.
- The SNES file format is also .srm, but on my psp the .srm was in uppercase, but it was easy to edit that as well.
- The GBA version of Final Fantasy VI sounds awful and runs slower, I might have to fiddle with the emulation settings, but I'll stick to the SNES run I already had, which runs so much better than PSP.
- Metroid Fusion, the first game I tried, ran wonderfully though.

I can't wait to play more of this tomorrow!
