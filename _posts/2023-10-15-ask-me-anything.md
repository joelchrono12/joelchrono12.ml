I don't have much time this morning, but I still wanted to ask here. Yesterday I did a quick post asking for questions my readers my be interested for me to answer.

If you have a question for me, leave it in my [post on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@joel/111236953653705271) but feel free to [contact me](/contact/) in any way you prefer if you feel like doing so, **encrypted email** is preferred.

As I said, I still have quite a bit of things to do today, but I'll answer some of the short questions I got yesterday. If I don't answer them all its because the reply is longer—or I didn't feel like it.

**[Benjamin Hollon asks](benjaminhollon.com/): Favorite kind of tea or herbal tea?**

A: Well, coffee is technically a tea, but if that doesn't count, mint. Not much of a tea guy.

**[Bahadir asks](https://fosstodon.org/@Bahadir) what was your first starter Pokemon?**

Squirtle, on Pokemon Fire Red for the GBA, playing from my HTC ChaChaCha using the My Boy emulator around 2015.

**[Adamsdesk asks](https://www.adamsdesk.com/) What's the next Origami?**

I haven't posted origami pictures in ages, I don't know what will be my next one, probably a frog, I haven't done frogs in ages.


This is enough for today, this is day 72 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
