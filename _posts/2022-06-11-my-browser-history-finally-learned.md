I know I could have set some setting somewhere to make my old domain not show up in suggestions.

In case you didn't know my old domain was a free .ml one, that I could not renew in time. It ended up being taken over by malware, VPN scams and other random things. Right now it looks like it does nothing bad but the certificates are all messed up.

It feels great to be able to type five letters and hit Enter rather than typing the whole domain (switching my hands to the arrow keys takes longer for me).

Either way, I am free of this hassle and I wanted to write a bit about it. It took around 4 months for Firefox to stop suggesting me my old domain. I wouldn't have thought it would take this long, but since I typed it for a whole year, I guess it kinda made sense.

In other news, I am trying to write shorter posts too, I realized that sometimes I really don't have too much to say about a topic, but I don't really want to make a thread on mastodon either. After all the point of doing [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) last year was not to write meaningful content, but to write something at all.

I recently gained some more inspiration thanks to [some posts by Chris Wiegman](https://chriswiegman.com/2022/06/the-writing-is-the-point/) as well as some people who recently joined the challenge, such as [Fury](https://fury.hk/blog/write-short-posts-and-write-faster) who has been going at it for a few days already. Make sure to give a visit to their sites if they seem interesting to you. I know they both are on my RSS reader. ðŸ˜‰
