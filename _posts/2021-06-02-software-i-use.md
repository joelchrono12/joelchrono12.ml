This is going to be a quick blog where I just wanted to mention how I added
this new section to my website, I already spent quite some time editing it, so
I guess I can make this blog shorter than the rest.

Inspired by [PsychoLama](https://fosstodon.org/@PsychoLlama) and by [Ru Singh](https://fosstodon.org/@celia), who have a "Recommendations" and
a "Uses" section respectively on their sites. I wanted to do the same, and decided to
get started on it as quick as possible.

Right now its still fairly incomplete, but I can update it when deemed
necessary, not only for new software I discover, but for the programs I stop
using.

This idea came out of the blue, I did not have a school class and
decided to go for it. It might as well be the most unplanned post yet.

I want to add some new sections in the future, a blogroll, a reading list, a
Now section, so many things to do. I will make a post whenever that happens.

Besides, the last couple months have been quite short on content,
and I wanted to add some extra entries to  keep up with the
[#100DaysToOffload](https://100DaysToOffload.com) challenge. Although at this
rate I feel confident I will complete it in less than a year!.

This has been day 40, almost halfway there!
