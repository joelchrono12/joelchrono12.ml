## Podcasts

I mostly stuck with the regulars this time, but there's one show I listened to years ago, and I'm going back to it.

- __SAYER__: this is a science fiction show that features an advanced AI who introduces the listener to their new home, the man-made second moon of Typhon. This is a fantastic bit of fiction, and I quite enjoy listening to it. It feels a bit like Welcome to Night Vale, but more dystopic and futuristic.

The regulars were: Into The Aether, Eye of the Duck, Stuff You Should Know and Late Night Linux.

## Books

I didn't read as much this month, I focused on many other things as my last few posts might tell you. I still started one book though.

- __Hothouse__ by Brian W. Aldiss, is an awesome piece of science fiction set a couple millions years in the future, where humanity has devolved into a more tribal existence, while vegetable life has become the dominant predator and lifeform, in a World where the earth stopped rotating, and radiation has changed the environment in unimaginable ways. So far, it is super inmersive and well crafted, and I hope I finish it this month.

## Manga

- __Kingdom__: Still following the current arc, if a few chapters behind. Our protagonists got bamboozled and the rest of the army is in dire need of help. Just go read Kingdom, I beg you. I read up to chapter 786.

- __Monster__: The finale is approaching, I only have 17 chapters to go to see the conclusion of this story. It is such an intriguing thriller and there are a lot of answers, and even more questions. A truly amazing story this is.

## Anime

- __Haikyu!! Seasons 1-4__: I have heard of this anime many times, proclaimed among the best modern sports anime shows. I have to say, I think I agree. I quite like volleyball, and I found the evolution of the characters, the rivalry, the challenges and how the Karasuno overcomes them, to be simply awesome. Besides, this is a show I watched with my sister, just so we can see the new movie that just came out in my country, and I have to say, I can't wait!

- __Ace of the Diamond__: This is a random anime I picked up out of a Short on YouTube. Why did I go for another sports anime? I have no idea. So many other things I could watch, and yet, I am still watching it. This is an anime where the protagonist is actually going through a lot of trouble before he actually becomes good, and I am quite hooked on his journey so far.

## Gaming

Here comes the juice of it all. I got a Miyoo Mini Plus recently, a little emulation handheld with support for a lot of different systems from the PS1 and below. And it comes with fantastic features like quick game switching and an activity tracker app, to see how much I use the thing!

Because of this, I've gamed a lot more than before. It doesn't help a got a fancy new game for the Switch that also hooked me completely.

- __The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown__: This is a Nintendo Switch title that completely took me by surprise. I already expected great things when I listened to the Into The Aether episode about it. I have played it for a dozen or so hours and its really fun to explore, the combat feels tight, although the story is rather weak. It is somewhere in between Hollow Knight and Metroid Dread with its challenging boss battles, as well as the satisfying movement of Ori.
- __Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga__: What can I say, I have played this for a while already and I am 10 hours in so far, it is such a fun little story and the combat system, while turn based, requires a lot more active input compared to a Final Fantasy or so, since you can defend from enemy attacks, or add bonus damage. I completely recommend this game. No random encounters, no grinding required, no complicated menus, no random party wipe attacks. It is one of the best entries to the genre, in my opinion, and I am still not done with it!
- __Advance Wars__: A fantastic little tactical RPG that I've been playing for a while. Like Mario & Luigi, it is a perfect fit for the Miyoo Mini Plus! I played almost all of the tutorial stages and I have enjoyed it a lot.
- __Celeste Classic__: A challenging platformer that I completed on the Miyoo Mini, it was very fun, but I admit I used save states a couple of times.
- __Super Mario Bros Wonder__: I am still playing levels from time to time, this month was particularly enjoyable, since I played it with many different people

I played many other games for testing on the Miyoo Mini Plus, but I not many exceeded the hour of playtime, so I dind't mention them for now.

## Device Usage

### Laptop Usage

Notice the rise in editing tools for the theme and icons I created for my Miyoo Mini Plus, as well as my file manager for the same thing. Of course, I blogged too.

- Firefox for 52 hours
- Thunar for 12 hours
- Alacrity for 11 hours
- Inkscape for 11 hours
- GIMP for 10 hours

### Phone Usage

I used my phone for a total of 203 hours. You can notice I changed from YouTube to Tubular late in the month, and I've been using Signal a lot more to talk with my friends!

- YouTube for 36 hours
- Tusky for 34 hours
- WhatsApp for 23 hours
- Signal for 19 hours
- Discord for 19 hours
- Cromite for 11 hours
- Aniyomi for 9 hours
- Tubular for 7 hours

### Kobo Usage

I only read for 3 hours this month. A bit of a letdown, but I am not sad about it, I enjoyed my time gaming and watching anime with my family.

## Finishing thoughts

This month was crazy, packed with a lot of stuff, but I had a great time with the WeblogPoMo challenge and everything else.

This is day 55 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
