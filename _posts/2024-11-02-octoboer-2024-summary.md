## Podcasts

I have to say that during this month I felt like I didn't listen to that many new podcasts, or new episodes at all, I actually didn't reach 60 hours of listening this month, and stuck with the same shows as always.

I can't really say a lot of new stuff or highlights about these since I mention them every month, so yeah, just the names this time

- **Into The Aether** for 15.1 hours
- **Trash Taste** for 10.6 hours
- **Welcome to Night Vale** for 6.9 hours
- **Late Night Linus** for 5.3 hours
- **Retro Game Time Machine** for 3.3 hours
- **Unexplained** for 2.4 hours

## Movies

Even though I didn't really watch any anime or shows this time around, I did watch more movies than usual, which was quite interesting to me.

- **Transformers One** was not a movie I expected to like enough to even [write a review](/blog/an-awesome-movie-to-sell-toysâ€”transformers-one/) of it, it is actually a fantastic movie that I recommend watching at some point, both fun and tragic, and it works!
- **Casino Royale** was the first of Daniel Craig's James Bond movies, and it is a very fun time! I think it was a little long, we actually watching it in two days because of that, but it was still pretty good.
- **Quantum of Solace** is the black sheep of these newer Bond movies, and I can see why, as the direction and fight scenes felt a lot clunkier, but I still enjoyed it for what it was.
- **Skyfall** regains its footing and has a lot of epic Bond movies, neither of these three movies (maybe the first one) is a masterpiece but hey, they kept me hooked so that's good.
- **Hercules** (the Disney one) was started by my sister on a whime and I just kept watching it, the animation of this movie remains stellar and I wish more 2D animated movies were a thing.
- **The Thing** from 1982 remains one of my favorite movies due to its direction and fantastical practical effects, and even though I am not a fan of horror as a whole, just the plot and concept of this one is absolutely fantastic, frightening and scary.

## Books

- **Leviathan Wakes** by James S.A. Corey from the Expanse series was *not* finished this month, but I only have like 10 chapters left now, I have really enjoyed my time with it, and the only reason I didn't finish it was because of procrastination and also that I didn't want to get ahead of my book club.
- **Black Easter** by James Blish is a rather interesting book set in a world where magic and demonology are actually real, and I started it on a whim when I catched up on the previous book too quickly. It is rather interesting and I'll probably finish it in November as well.

## Manga

**Jujutsu Kaisen** was everything this time, so, not a lot else to talk about as other non-mange things entertained me more this month.

## Anime

**Dungeon Meshi** was watched up to episode 13 with my sister, still awesome! And it got some interesting plot developments, I hope we finish it in November.

## Gaming

- **Fire Emblem: Blazing Blade** is a tactics RPG I started playing ages ago, I recently got back into it on my Anbernic RG35XX SP and it is honestly really fun!
- **Nintendo Switch Sports** was a recent purchase and I've played with family and friends at home, it is quite a relaxing game. I am a bit annoyed that there are still many games missing from Wii Sports and Resort that did not get an update for this game, but it is how it is.
- **WEBFISHING** is a very interesting fishing game where you can play online with others and chat while fishing and collecting different things. It is a rather relaxing and cozy game that I feel everyone should try!
- **Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition** was started early in the month and has pretty much become my night time videogame, so far the early hours of the game are rather nice, and every time I load up the game it tells me how the story is going so far, I really just getting back to it, playing 30 minutes and always reaching a good point to save, or just put the Switch to sleep and continue later.
- **Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown** had a lot of momentum the first week of the month, playing like 8 hours of it in just 3 days, but other things got in the way. I must finish it in Novebember, it has proven to be a fantastic game and I just keep doing other things, but it is definitely my top game of the year.
- **Astroboy Omega Factor** for the GBA was a little gem I didn't expect to enjoy as much, I think I played like 3 hours of it in a day and I think I will finish it soon this month, if I remember to pick it back up.
- **Monster Hunter Rise** saw some action later in the month, playing online with a friend and teaching them the ways of the hunter. I look forward to playing some more during these last couple months.
- **Faster Than Light** was not played much, but the last week of October I managed to finally reach the final stage and I almost defeated the final ship, I only needed to do one more hit, but it wasn't meant to be...

## Device usage

For some reason, this month I decided to try an app to chat with random people around the world, I do not think the app is really good UX-wise, but it somehow kept me entertained a lot, cutting down a lot of my YouTube usage and Manga reading. As I met interesting people to chat with, I moved to other apps, I only used it like 4 hours in the last week of October and it'll probably see less usage later on.

Regardless, here are the stats.

### Laptop

I used my laptop for a total of 81 hours

- Firefox for 55 hours
- GIMP for 5 hours
- Alacritty for 4 hours
- WEBFISHING for 5 hours
- Faster Than Light for 2 hours

### Phone

I used my phone for 222 hours


- Bottled for 44 hours
- WhatsApp for 30 hours
- YouTube for 30 hours
- Signal for 20 hours
- Firefox for 18 hours
- Tusky for 17 hours
- Discord for 14 hours
- Instagram for 8 hours
- Mihon for 4 hours

### E-Reader

During October, I read for a total of 12:42 hours, 748 pages:

- **Leviathan Wakes** for  9:39 hours, 568 pages
- **Black Easter** for 2:30 hours, 138 pages

## Final thoughts

So, yeah, a lot of my time was completely stolen by that chatting app, but I think I'm over it now, and I want to focus on both reading and gaming more this month of November, as well as writing a lot of blog posts! I actually joined [#WritingMonth](https://writingmonth.org/) with the goal of 15 blog posts before the month ends.

This is day 85 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
