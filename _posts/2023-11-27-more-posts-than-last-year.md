I wanted to write about something because its been a week since my last blogpost and I'm also running out of days this year. 

There were many possible topics. The obvious one was about the first few days of my new job, my experience, my coworkers, the courses, etc. But its honestly not that interesting to everybody, and even if it is, it would be kind of too long for me. 

There's also the fact that I finished a book (Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir) and I kinda wanna make book reviews a bit of a regular thing here, so I'll come back to it at some point.

Another topic was maybe gaming, I haven't played much by myself but I've played multiplayer switch games quite a bit on weekends. We've played stuff like TMNT: Shredder's Revenge and also Castle Crushers. Or I could've written about the dozen or so games I randomly installed on my new phone.

I was also inspired by my purchase of a new watch, a Casio A-168. [Adamsdesk asked me](https://fosstodon.org/@adamsdesk/111458684670609435) where is my blogpost about my current watch collection, and sadly, there's none! But that seems like an interesting idea for the following weeks.

Lastly, I tried to buy some LTT merch—*lttstore dot com*—because they had some insane Black Friday deals, but I ended up getting my debit card blocked (my fault) and it was a bit of a funny experience. So idk maybe later.

However, after checking my blog archive, I noticed that last year I wrote a total of 82 posts, and that I was about to reach that very same amount thanks to this very writing.

And so, I decided to just write about that fun fact I noticed and how happy it makes me. This has been my most productive year ever, at least when it comes to writing, so that's something right? 

This is day 82 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
