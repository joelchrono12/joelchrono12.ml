This was not a bad week at all I must say, I was very active every day, with different things showing up at work and at home, so yeah, here are some notes about it.

- üñ•Ô∏è **New desk and keyboard!** I can't stress enough how happy I am with how my setup turned out. The time spent assembling the desk and doing the manual work paid off well with the final result, I'm very happy with the keyboard too, it's my first mechanical one, but I can't really say much else, I like it.
- üí™ **I didn't go at all to the gym this week**, again. I have failed to commit. Same excuse, my parents weren't home so I'd rather get home early from work. I am definitely going agin this week.
- üÉè **New card game!** *That's Not A Hat*, it's about exchanging gifts (represented with cards with very simple drawings, like glasses or shoes). The problem is, the cards are face down! It's a memory and bluffing game, after an exchange, you can say *"that's not a (blank)!"* Whoever is wrong, loses a point. It's surprisingly hard, but extremely fun. I kept forgetting the cards I gifted, and I almost never knew what card I had in my hand. I highly recommend it!
- üèûÔ∏è **Went outside!** This past Saturday I catched up with some old friends, we had some tacos for lunch and we chatted for quite a while. It's nice to spend time with friends I've known since my teenage years! We had had a chance to meet months ago, but things didn't line up, so it was about time.
- üöå My coworker went on a **business trip** and I had the whole plant under my care. He still replied to some calls and solved issues from him side, but I still had to attend some meetings and do some troubleshooting for areas I was not very familiar with, it was nice to learn more about everything.
- üõç Went **shopping** for a bit! That's how I bought *That's Not A Hat*, but I also got a really cool graphic t-shirt with a cool NASA design. I also got myself my first ever Manga volume! volume 38 of Hunter x Hunter, which I haven't reached yet anyway, but I liked the art.

## üìΩÔ∏è Watching

Decided to add a section for this stuff already, as I always mix it up with the regular notes and well, so I grouped everything that features video content here.

- **Karate Kid Legends** - it was very fun! With Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio teaming up for the first time, to train Ben Wang in both Kung Fu and Miyagi-Do Karate. The movie goes way too fast in many areas, but I still enjoyed it for what it was and found the fight scenes to be really cool and well choregraphed, many of them filled with Jackie Chan's signature style. Some things could be handled better, but it entertained me.
- **Mob Psycho 100** - This is the first anime I rewatch completely from start to finish, and it makes sense, since I think that, right now, it's my favorite anime of all time. Excellent ending, excellent character development, absolutely top notch animation style. An incredible show all around.
- **The Last Of Us Season 2** - Good episode that made me feel sad about how we ended up how we did, again. It hurts guys, it hurts. Stil gotta watch the last episode though üò≠
- **Weak Hero** - watched another episode, and yes, the manhwa is 100% still better than this. The drama do be drama on this one, people just react in the weirdest, most extreme ways possible to stuff that could be solved with a conversation, but well.

## üïπÔ∏è Gaming

Fun fact, I didn't play any Nintendo Switch this week, I am actually rather surprised at this fact. But well, I am kinda happy about it! Still want to finish the games I've been playing there though.

- **Castlevania Aria of Sorrow** - I have managed to make more progress on this game! I have been exploring the castle a little more, I found a teleport room in an area I had already visited, I found some equipment, I found a cool armor set that was blocked by some environmental hazard but I used a soul skill to get past it. Enjoyable Metroidvania stuff once again!
- **Final Fantasy VI** - Decided to return to this one for some reason. I am on my way to the Sealed Gate, which seems like a pretty important place. I am in a cave filled with treacherous terrain and lava pit falls. Thankfully I think I got past the worst of it, and I've found some chests with good loot. I think I found a good rhythm for this one again.

## üìï Reading

I read one book and two manga, which are the following:
- **The Big Time** - Up to chapter 6. I am starting to get it a bit more, it reads very weird when compared to other stuff, someone said it's almost like reading a play, and I think I agree with the sentiment.  I think I'm starting to get it a bit more. The last chapter I read and listened via the [Librivox audiobook](https://librivox.org/the-big-time-by-fritz-leiber). I might continue doing that for the rest of the book.
- **How to Grill Our Love** - Up to chapter 89. The story continues to be quite charming! I can't believe it continues to be in the spotlight for the 3rd week straight.
- **Hunter x Hunter** - Up to chapter 363. I finally decided to catch up a bit on HxH, after buying a physical volume of it. The current arc is building up to something really interesting, but the pieces still don't quite fall into place for it to get going, I think. It may be a little too much build-up at this point, but it's fine . Maybe once I get into reading it more I'll fly through it again.
