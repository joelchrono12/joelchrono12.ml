Well, I completed the challenge! quoting the website directly:

> You will post as much as you can, ideally daily, but we all have lives, so go easy on yourself. This is meant to be fun!

Indeed, we all have lives, and most of mine was spent playing and thinkering with the Miyoo Mini Plus, creating icons and a theme for it. Or playing the _Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown_ on my Switch, or watching 3 seasons and a half of the sports anime _Haykiu!!_ for the sake of my sister---and eventually my own---so we can go watch the movie coming out today in MÃ©xico. And of course---I also have a job.


I was already a bit unsure about me doing a blog per month, I had [done it before]({{ site.url }}/blog/#January-2023), but a lot of my evenings were spent on all those other things---I didn't even finish my [Top 25 Games post](https://fosstodon.org/@joel/112406897446236500) like I intended. That's alright for me, since I still wasn't happy with how I was writing it. I will dedicate a some more time to complete it.


Alas, the month is over, and the challenge was completed. I would have liked to go for the 31 posts I originally wanted, but I am happy with how things turned out, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

I am happy I took it relatively easy, after all this is not something I wanted to force myself into. I wrote when I wanted, and that was ok. 

Regardless, I blame my Miyoo Mini Plus for everything. But I can't really get mad at such a cute little portable device. It's just too good!

Be it gaming, blogging, reading or watching anime, it's all good!

I'll write my monthly recap, so you can expect more detail on what other shenanigans I got myself into tomorrow as well.

This is day 54 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/), and post 22 for [#WeblogPoMo2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024).
