After writing my post about [constantly seeking
entertainment](/blog/the-constant-need-for-a-source-of-entertainment),
I have also tried to avoid listening to music while I write, I've been
quite successful at it for the last few days. Nothing but the noise of
my environment---and the music playing inside my head.

There are certain songs that just stick with me to sometimes, and that
I'll just hum whenever I am bored or if I feel like entertaining
myself.

These are not necesarily my favorite songs of all time, but they are
easy to put on repeat in my brain without really being annoying. This
is different to an earworm, or catchy songs I listen once and then
can't get out. They are usually simple *leitmotifs* I find incredibly
memorable and suitable to play in a moment's notice.

Some are just hummed or playing in my head, others are melodies I'll
play on my guitar whenever I pick it up---I play the guitar guys!
That's something I don't mention often.

Even if they are not my favorites, they are still in my playlists and
will show up from time to time, and I will always enjoy them, so I
thought they would be something kind of fun to share, so here is a
sample!

- [In Your Hands](https://youtu.be/vLxBRGNeqxI) - Berlinist - Gris

Takaoka, Masanori Hikichi - Terranigma

Zelda: Majora's Mask

Forest](https://youtu.be/mbkEfHwHlBs) - Yasunori Mitsuda - Chrono
Trigger

- [Under Cover of
Night](https://youtu.be/sHzGs2fTOUs) - Martin
O'Donnell - Halo
- [Eye of The Tiger](https://youtu.be/btPJPFnesV4) - Survivor - Rocky
- [Sunflower](https://youtu.be/ApXoWvfEYVU) - Post Malone - Into the Spiderverse
- [Immortals](https://youtu.be/Y4o_8zbelwY) - Fall Out Boy - Big Hero 6

As soon as I started picking songs, I immediately thought of adding
more and more, so I listened to some playlists to remember if any rang
a bell. This ended up being detrimental, and slowly turned into "songs
I like to hum when I remember them" instead of "songs I actually hum
unprompted", so I tried to keep it short and not think too hard about
it. I only looked up the songs to credit them properly.

Honestly, there's plenty more missing! The allocated storage for music in my brain is quite big I think.

There's a printer spitting out pages at a certain rythm and now I'm humming *Staying Alive*. Enough is enough.

This post was inspired by Amin's post about [listening to less music](https://benjaminhollon.com/musings/listening-to-less-music)---although pretty different to what he wrote.

What are some of the songs you like to hum and play in your head? [Let me know](/contact)!
