I did not want to make this blog, I was kinda wanting to sleep, but I have already make some work on this, so I decided to share it, and also to not miss one day of this challenge.

The description summed it up pretty quickly. I have to make a game, and it will work as a final project. I decided to start once and for all. It has to be a text-based adventure game, which is something I have been wanting to do for a while, and now I will be able to do what I want, while also earning points for doing it.

I decided to use the Godot Engine, which is a free and open source engine that I have [mentioned before](/blog/gamedev-getting-started/). I know that at the end of the day I could make something using bash or a simpler language, but I want to be able to use some simple graphical effects to achieve a retro look. This can be considered the first devlog of this little series, where I will describe how I ended up where I am.

# Watching tutorials

So, Godot is not known for its huge library of video tutorials and guides, but it has been growing exponentially, and it is pretty easy to find help in forums or Discord servers. I found two tutorials that deal with simple problems. The first one is a stand alone simple tutorial that shows a simple way to make it, link [here](https://youtu.be/6OTZH82e2t8).
It proved to be useful mostly because it shows me code of some things that will be great to me, and gave me some ideas of how I will expand my version.
The next tutorial is actually an ongoing [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpwc3ughKbZfkSPko3azFD4dd4IHSiQeE) that has currently 3 videos, but it looks pretty promision and its very beginner friendly, so if you are looking to get into Godot, its actually quite a nice way to start.

# My current progress

So I decided to get started with the UI, it is kinda basic, but it looks pretty minimal and nice, if I do say so myself. I added some glyphs, rounded corners, and of course, the nord color scheme

I also decided to make some simple commands which can be seen on the picture. They work in quite a simple way. Here you can see how they work. The text language is in Spanish (and some English because my mind is weird) since thats the language we speak here. But you can get the idea, and I might translate it all anyways.

# I will keep you updated
As of now, that's basically it, I am going to make a repo and I will also share my progress as I go on with this adventure. This was day 19 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
