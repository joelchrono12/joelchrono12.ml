Hello again, this time around is the same as always. As I've mentioned before, I got a job! So I keep lacking just as much time as before, but its alright. I've been enjoying the stuff I have learned and I still have plenty of time that I just waste scrolling around on YouTube and Mastodon. I ended up disabling Mastodon notifications which has helped a lot and I feel a lot better about it when I use it. YouTube not so much, but its all work in progress.

# Podcasts

Last month I didn't listen to as many podcasts as I usually do, it was only around 45 hours of content this time around.

It was more of the usual stuff, such as Welcome to Night Vale, Dungeons and Daddies and Waveform.

Ars Paradoxica was the only (old)new show I listened to, I started it years ago but I decided to go back to it from the beginning and I am liking it a lot. Its a sci-fi drama about a physicists, Sally Grissom, who ends up travelling back in time by mistake. Its really good!

# Manga

- **Mosquito Wars**: I finished all the 48 chapters. After *All You Need is Kill*, I saw this manhwa mentioned as kinda similar, and I realized that it was written by the same guy who did *The Boxer* and *The Horizon* (Two God Tier manhwas that you *must* read) I knew I would have to give it a go. Its simply fantastic and it goes places. Its the closest thing I've read to Evangelion. Just fantastic. Art, composition, story and characters, they're all great. I don't think it reaches the level of his other works, but its great anyway.
- **Alita Battle Angel**: Read up to chapter 44. I got back into Alita and it keeps going, it definitely lost some momentum but its picking up a little bit.
- **Survival**: Read up to chapter 85. I don't know how I stumbled upon this old, classic manga, but it follows a boy who survives a Great Catastrophe that sinks down 90% of the planet, including a bunch of Japan. The boy has to survive against nature and what strives him to keep going is the hope of reuniting with his family. Not only does he have to face the dangers of nature taking over, but also face what such a situation does to the remnant of humanity.
- **Survival: Another Story**: This is a side story volume in between of Survival's main plot, its about the boy finding a seeemingly normal city that is turned into a dictatorship. It is full of weird mysteries and stuff. I finished all 12 chapters.
- **Chi No Wadachi**: This is a manga I started a while ago, it is quite a psychological manga about a mother and his only son. It ended a while ago, and I caught up to finish it. It was a weird and sad story that somehow remains hopeful until the end. I think its worth it, but its not for everyone.

# Movies

**The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes:** I went blind on this movie and I was pleasantly surprised, you don't need to know much about the universe other than it is a prequel and the main character is the villain of the original trilogy, it was very interesting and the Hunger Games were pretty action packed too, it delivered, in my opinion.

# Device Usage

Because of my new job I haven't had as much time to do anything for myself, so my time using my personal devices got drastically reduced, even more than before, since using my phone was necessary during my internship. Its a nice change of pace to be honest.

## Laptop Usage
I only used my computer for 60 hours this month. Honestly, I spent a lot more time on my phone and with my family watching TV and stuff.

- Firefox got used for 50 hours
- Alacritty was used for 8 hours

## Phone Usage

I kinda forgot to install Activity Watch, so I don't have the full stats this time around. I'll just sort the apps from most used to least used

- YouTube: I mostly used it for shorts this time. While at work its just nice to have them during my breaks.
- Tachiyomi: This is the second best thing, its quick to read a couple pages from time to time or in the bathroom lol.
- WhatsApp
- Tusky
- Facebook
- Cromite

# Finishing thoughts

There are many things I've been meaning to write about, as I mentioned in my previous post, and I only have 17 more posts to go this year. Let's hope for the best!
