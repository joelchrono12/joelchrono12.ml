Alright, so, again, inspired by many of the websites I saw during my tour of the indie web and the like.

I got a bit inspired to do some changes around this place. I spent so much time doing said changes and fixes that I am honestly too tired to do a proper explanation of everything I did. I was also so lazy that I worked on a single commit all the time just amending the changes I was doing on it. Don't worry, I also did a good branch to test all the changes being done. I kind of want to figure out how to merge certain commits to a different branch and such, to, for example, move this article to a different branch but not move all the CSS and layout changes I've done.

Regardless, here are some of the changes I did in a simple list to call it a day and go mindlessly watch YouTube videos:

### Changed the background to the Time Gate animation from Chrono Trigger.

I googled a bit and found a very awesome animation you can admire here:

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/AnimatedSecretHectorsdolphin' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

As I've said many times, __Chrono Trigger__ is my absolute favorite game of all time, the only game I've completed more than once and I will probably play it again this year, its kind of an unwritten law for me.

Anyways, that video, converted to a GIF or WEBP animation, would still weight a ton. Therefore I decided to compress it a lot.
