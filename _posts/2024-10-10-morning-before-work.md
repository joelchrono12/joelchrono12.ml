description: I just arrived to my bus to work, and decided to write about how my morning started today

Every morning I wake up, give thanks for a new day, and get ready for work—unless it's a weekend of course.

I usually sleep while listening to podcasts, this time was no different. Sometimes I just leave the phone's speaker do the job by my beside, and others, I plug an earphone to my left ear and just sleep with my head turned to the right. Last night it was the latter.

After making my bed, I left my phone and earphones charging—don't charge electronic devices at night kids—ate a bowl of froot loops, did my hairdo, washed my teeth, picked up my backpack and things and walked to the work bus.

I usually get ready while listening to podcasts, this time was no different, I listened to the last 30 minutes or so of [*Into the Aether - A Low Key Video Game Podcast: 30 Going On 100*](https://intothecast.transistor.fm/episodes/30-going-on-100-feat-ufo-50-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-monster-rancher-dx-1-2-and-romancing-saga-2-remake) which talked about *UFO 50*, *Echoes of Wisdom*  and other interesting games, I was getting out of the house when it ended, and a Stuff Should Know episode, [*The Shadow Biosphere: Is There Other Life on Earth?*](https://stuffyoushouldknow.com/episodes/?instance_id=b0b47b59-f70d-4b6a-84b6-0adc1e09d4f0) was next on my queue.

I kept on walking, the same path as always. Across a crop field, across the street, a few more blocks away, the bus already awaits. I leave home around the time the sun is rising, I walk towards it. The episode is very interesting, talking about how narrow our definition of life is and that maybe stepping outside those boundaries can help us find totally new lifeforms within the planet.

During my walks I prefer to leave audio play through my phone speakers, so I am still aware of my sorroundings, maybe it's a bit weird for the people who pass by, but I don't mind. Sadly, not many of them understand English, I wonder what they think of that one guy always walking with some weird radio show playing on his phone. Especially if I'm listening to *Into The Aether*  and the hosts start laughing like maniacs because of a pun they came up with.

Once I get to the bus, I pause the podcast—I don't mind passers-by but I'm not gonna annoy everyone in my work bus—and proceed to take my earbuds out of my backpack to resume playing.

I forgot my earbuds.

My day is off to a rough start.

This is day 81 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com).
