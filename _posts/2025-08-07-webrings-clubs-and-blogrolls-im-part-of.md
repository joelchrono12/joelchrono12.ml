One of the always ongoing quests of mine consists of keeping all my urls up to date. After almost 5 years of blogging, I've changed my domain name a few times, from just my `.netlify.app` subdomain, to`joelchrono12.ml`, to `joelchrono12.xyz` to the cleaner and shorter `joelchrono.xyz` of today.

Nowadays I still keep the last two, with a simple redirect, but I have been exploring around looking for websites linking to me and sending emails for them requesting to update my web address and so.

Because of this process, I've encountered websites that have added me to their blogrolls or linked me in some way, and I thought it'd be fun to share some of those. While we are at it, I have linked to some other sites that I'm a part of, from clubs, webrings, viral challenges, independent search engines and some other mentions I found.

I think I want to create a [/slashpage](https://slashpages.net) for this, but I am not too sure about what to call it, maybe something along the lines of **/memberships** or **/mentions**? let me know what you think!

**Update**: I can't believe I forgot this since I literally read Wouter's post recently, but he did an [/impact](https://brainbaking.com/impact/) featuring the sites that have mentioned him as well, although he listed them by country, and made a heat map too. Go check it out!

Alas, here is an incomplete compilation of links that link me back!

## Blogrolls

Sorry that I didn't add a description for this section, there are just, quite a bit of them so, I got lazy. Thinking about it, is this basically a reverse blogroll? ðŸ¤¯

## Webrings

These are fun, webrings are a series of websites that link to each other, until they form a ring! (check the footer on this site). Say hi to my neighbors.

- [Polyring Club](https://polyring.club): A ring for polymaths, and almost everyone.
- [Fediring](https://fediring.net): Are you in the fediverse? You can be here too.
- [Geekring](https://geekring.net): I think you know the gist of this one already.
- [Static Quest](https://static.quest): If your website is static html, hand-made or generated, welcome!
- ~~[IndieWeb Webring](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws)~~: I think I messed up the setup required for this one, will fix later.


## Directories

I think there are plenty of these out there, but I haven't really looked for more.

- [Blogroll.org](https://blogroll.org): A human curated blogroll directory.
- [Bukmark Club](https://bukmark.club): If you link to other sites in your own, you show up here!
- [Blogroll.club](https://blogroll.club): Another human curated blogroll directory!
- [Indieseek.xyz](https://indieseek.xyz): A human edited Indieweb directory.

## Clubs

These are kind of like webrings but there's no ring, just a site listing sites that fit a certain critera, just for fun.

- [512Kb Club](https://512kb.club): For very light websites.
- [1MB Club](https://1mb.club): For kinda light websites.
- [Dark Theme Club](https://darktheme.club): For websites with dark themes.

## Challenges

I've participated in a couple of different challenges or online events where I got listed, it's neat.

- [100 Days To Offload](https://100daystooffload.com): Just write 100 posts in a day and you're good. I did it 4 times.
- [CSS Naked Day 2024](https://css-naked-day.org/2024.html): Get rid of that stylesheet for once.
- [WeblogPoMo2024](https://weblogpomo.club/participators): A month long blogging challege started by [Anne Sturdivant](https://anniegreens.omg.lol/).
- [Blaugust 2025](https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/08/03/blaugust2025-meet-the-mentors-blogroll/): A month long blogging challenge started by [Belghast](https://aggronaut.com/)
- [Blog Question Replies](https://birming.com/blog-question-replies): A list of participants of blog question challenges.
- [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me): People who have listed their app defaults.

## Search engines

I mean, I obviously show up in search engines, but a couple of the independent ones have added me to their index too, and I'm happy to shout them out regardless.

- [Clew](https://clew.se): The search engine being developed by Amin.
- [Kagi's Small Web](https://kagi.com/smallweb/): A random website is opened with that link, sometimes mine shows up!
- [Marginalia Search](https://marginalia-search.com/site/joelchrono.xyz?view=links): A pretty cool search engine.
- [Wiby.me](https://wiby.me): A search engine like the early internet days.
