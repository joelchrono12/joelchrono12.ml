Here's what I did this month!

## Podcasts

I listened to 96 hours of podcasts! Although a fair amount of that was
while asleep.

- __Trash Taste__ had some really entertaining episodes recently so of course I
listened to some of them!
- I listened to many of the __Late Night Linux Family__ shows, more than usual
for some reason.
- __The Vergecast__ was also really interesting lately, with their episodes
about Gemini and Google being a monopoly
- __Stuff You Should Know__ was indeed awesome
- __Darknet Diaries__ was left behind for a bit lately, but not anymore
- __Into The Aether__ had some fun stuff, but they took a break for a bit so,
yeah.
- __Dungeons and Daddies__ was also fun, I am following season 3 as episodes
come out.
- __Relatos de la Noche__ remained on top, as my new favorite for night time
listening.

## Anime & Shows

- **Dr. Stone** was pretty unexpected, but I chose it on a whim and I basically
caught up with it and now I'm just waiting for the time a new season,
probably the last one, comes out. The plot is quite interestin; in a world
were humanity got turned to stone, pretified for millenia, and the elements
deteriorated every building and sight of its existence, leaving almost
nothing left. By sheer luck, a teenage scientist breaks out of his
petrification, and decides to figure out how to undo petrification and
build back civilization with the power of science!

- **Loki season 2** was quite the ride, I watched it with a friend in 2 days and it was pretty entertaining, I really like the timey-wimey stuff in it. There were some great developments but my biggest take-away is that I want to watch Doctor Who again.

## Manga

- **Sakamoto Days** made a return with all of its might. I had forgotten
how crazy it went with a lot of its fight scenes. I appreciate the
creativeness of a lot of its panels and how things developed, it got me
hooked until I catched up to its latest chapter. There are a ton of
stunning visuals here and I can only hope the anime for it---they
definitely have took their time releasing one---manages to do it justice. I
am on chapter 178.

- **DanDaDan** is got a lot of reading time from me as well, but I still a
few dozen chapters until I catch up with it. Still, the arc I read was
totally crazy like always, but a bit smaller in scale. Despite this, the
new character is definitely among my favorites now. I am on chapter 129 so
far.

- **Creature!** is a manga I started a while ago and that I found totally
amusing to read, it wasn't good in the same sense as SD or DDD, but its art
was too good for a story that kept going all over the place. I kinda want
to find more stories like this of humans surviving some world full of
unsurmountable creatures and dangers in some apocalyptic world that also
has a serious tone, other than Attack on Titan I guess, which also evolves
into something different but in a better way.

- **How to Grill Our Love** is maybe my favorite cooking manga---a.k.a. the
only one I've read---with a wholesome marriage in the middle of it all. I
don't know what else to say, its a pretty comfy read and I want to it all
the food being cooked in it.

## Gaming

- **Final Fantasy VI** has been really enjoyable, I played a ton of it last month, pretty much a third of the story is complete.
- **Monster Hunter Rise** has also seen a revival, I am almost done with the village quests and I'll be doing some of the Guild quests soon enough. I really want to get some new gear though, like the Nargacuga set and some more elemental weapons.
- **Trails in the Sky FC** saw some progress early in the month, but it stalled for a bit later on, I'll still try and return to it since its been super enjoyable.

## Reading

- **Hothouse** by Brain W. Aldiss is a book I returned to after a while focusing on gaming instead of reading. The story has evolved in unexpected ways and I want to finish it quickly in September to focus on another book!

## Device usage

### Laptop

I am not sure why but I think I kinda borked my ActivityWatch data for this month, I don't really know what happened exactly, but I'm fairly angry right now...

### Phone

I used my phone for 223 hours which is kind of horrifying but welp.

- Youtube for 52 hours (help)
- Facebook for 25 hours (help)
- WhatsApp for 20 hours (help)
- Aniyomi for 19 hours (Dr. Stone lol)
- Tusky for 17 hours
- Discord for 15 hours
- Firefox for 12 hours
- Mihon for 11 hours
- Signal for 9 hours

### E-Reader

- I read **Hothouse** for for 4 hours and 8 minutes, 204 pages

## Final thoughts

Anyway, I lost my laptop data but I am quite sure I didn't use it very much anyway. Especially because of the anime binge-watching I did earlier in the month as well as the manga and book reading. And of course, the amount of YouTube I consumed.

I guess everything always balances out and it is what it is. Regardless, have a good day everyone!
