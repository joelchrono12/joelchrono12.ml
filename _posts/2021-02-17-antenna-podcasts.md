Around 2 years ago, I started to get interested in podcasts, due to the release of  Google Podcasts (interestingly enough). I had heard about them, and I was starting to get into programming, so I decided to try the app and look up for some podcasts that talked about those kind of themes.

Honestly, after a few days I just forgot about it and uninstalled the app, but thats how I got interested in them (*Thanks Google*).

Months later, I tried [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/), a free and open source app that allowed me to do the same thing, and I liked it a lot, it just had quite an ugly interface, but I was willing to give it a try.

They recently got a very nice redesign that gets rid of the Holo interface for something based on current Material design guidelines (still a bit rough around the edges, as most FOSS projects). And I have been listening to more podcasts lately, so I wanted to share this app because it is quite fantastic.

I keep a backup of the full database thanks to Syncthing, similarly of [how I manage my RSS feeds](/rss-usage/). but it allows to export to simple OPML files too, but I like the stats it gives me, so saving them for everytime I [reboot my phone](/changing-android-rom) is quite nice.

# Some podcasts suggestions. ðŸ“»

I have a lot of subbed podcasts that I listen from time to time, but these are a few that I consistently listen to, or that are finished shows that I enjoyed.

* [**Wolf 359:**](https://wolf359radio.libsyn.com/rss) A broadcast from space, full of humor at first, maybe a bit too relaxed at the beginning, but the mystery builds up quite nicely, listened to it last year, really worth it if you like sci-fi and pop references.
* [**Phoebe Reads a Mystery:**](http://feeds.feedburner.com/PhoebeReadsAMystery) I listen to this sometimes before sleeping, quite a relaxing voice, and the novels available at the moment are great, right now I am listening to 20000 Leagues Under the Sea, which Ive read before but in Spanish.
* [**Darknet Diaries:**](https://feeds.megaphone.fm/darknetdiaries) Hackers, viruses and cyber-security stuff, quite entertaining to listen to if you like that kind of stuff, not too technical.
* [**The Great Detectives of Old Time Radio:**](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GreatDetectivesOfOldTimeRadio) I also like to listen to this before going to sleep, these are recordings from radio shows from the 1940s, sometimes the music is a bit loud (listen to the intro and you will get it), but I really like them. 
* [**Archive 81:**](https://archive81.libsyn.com/rss) The contents of tapes from an old archive, which contains some pretty weird stuff. Currently listening to this one, the first season is great, I listened to all of it in a single day, I am currently going through the second one which has longer episodes.
* [**Welcome to Night Vale:**](http://feeds.nightvalepresents.com/welcometonightvalepodcast) The radio from a weird town, very mysterious but kinda fun. It's very easy to binge listen.
* [**Destination Linux:**](https://destinationlinux.org/feed/mp3/) Linux news and FOSS news, But I usually watch it on its video format.
* [**Crime Junkie:**](https://feeds.megaphone.fm/ADL9840290619) I listen to this one from time to time, but not a lot lately. The first episode I listened of it was too good though.
* [**The Bright Sessions:**](https://feeds.megaphone.fm/thebrightsessions) A psychologist who treats special people who have powers, a bit too dramatical for me sometimes, and I am a bit stuck due to lack of time. But pretty good.

# Finishing up 

There is another FOSS podcasts app that I quite like, named [Tsacdop](https://github.com/stonega/tsacdop), this one is not developed by a whole community like Antennapod, so it is still quite in its early stages, but you can still try it out, since it has a very unique feel to it, I really love its layout.

Anways, Antennapod is a very good app, they also have their own [forums](https://forum.antennapod.org/) where you can leave suggestions and bug reports, and contribute in any way you want. It is still quite active in development, and is one of those FOSS apps that can have a fair fight against their non-free (as in freedom) competitors, such as Podcast Addict and others (Google Podcasts is not even close by the way).

If you have any other podcasts that I should listen to, please let me know, this has been day 13 of [#100DaystoOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
