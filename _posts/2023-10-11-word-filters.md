With the quantity of information we expose ourselves to everyday, I think word filters are a great idea, be it on your feed reader or social media of choice, they're pretty useful!

The world's is upside down lately, and there are a lot of things I would rather avoid, and I am sure I'm not the only one with this problem.

Of course, I am talking about Amazon's Prime Day deals, I don't like Prime Day deals, they're coarse and rough and irritatingâ€¦ and they get everywhere. Not like here. Here everything is soft and smooth, and full of nice geeky references.

Thankfully, FreshRSS, [which I've been using for a while](/blog/self-hosting-my-news-feed-with-freshrss), allows me to automatically set as read any article in a manner of ways. For example, based on the title of the article, it's author, or the content of it! All you need to do this is go to the feed settings of whatever website you want to configure, scroll down to the **Filter Actions** section, and set whatever parameters you want using a format like this example:

```
intitle:"prime day"
author:"kev quirk"
inurl:"amazon"
```

You can check [FreshRSS's documentation](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/users/10_filter.html) for more options to try out!

Of course, Mastodon also has a great word filter feature, which will automatically hide posts in your timeline if they use a word you have blocked. You can even choose to just minimize the post with the possibility of expanding it, or just hide it completely, never to be seen again.

Overall, Mastodon users are quite alright at using content warnings and moderating themselves, but a few things are bound to slip and if you know you dislike reading about certain things, you should do your homework too!

Simply go to *Mastodon's settings > Filters > Add new filter* and filter away!
