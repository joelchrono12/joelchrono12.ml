So, today was quite a productive day for me, despite what the title may imply. Tuesdays are some of the most time-consuming days for me. I have to do the dishes, clean up the dog's business, collect and take out the trash, get dirty clothes ready for washing and many other chores that I do because there's no day as free for me as this one, speaking of school and other work.

Of course, it really isn't that much of a deal since my computer managed to stay on for 5 hours today, according to [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net), which can be a bit buggy sometimes, but it is mostly believable.

So, during that time I actually spent quite a lot of times browsing random websites from all sorts of places, with a single mission in my head: To find as many buttons as possible. What do I mean you may say? Well I wanted to see how many of these I could find:

{% include img.html image="/assets/img/blogs/2023-02-09-badges.jpg" caption="Set of buttons with a resolution of 88x31, can be found in my footer too" %}

These badges of a size of 88x31 got the better out of me, as I mentioned in [yesterday's post](/blog/free-time-warhammer-site-buttons/). After that I ended up making one for my website and one for [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org), [100DaysToOffload](https:/100daystooffload.com) and the [512kb Club](https://512kb.club). These badges used to be very common back in the day, and they still are in a lot of small sites, usually those belonging to [neocities](https://neocities.org), inspired by the old web and the like.

Anyway, I already talked a bit about them yesterday, even if it was in a very quick manner. Turns out it used to be (or probably still is?) a [standard size for ads](https://theoldnet.com/get?url=www.iab.net%2Fiab_products_and_industry_services%2F508676%2F508767%2FAd_Unit&year=2010&scripts=false&decode=false) back in the day, known as a Micro Bar, interesting stuff!

Regardless, I came across a bunch of sites, I made use of [webrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring), which is, as the name implies, a bunch of websites that link to one another in a link. You may have noticed I belong to one of them in the bottom of this website, the [Fediring](https://fediring.net), which is made of a bunch of blogs and digital gardens that belong to users of the Fediverse platforms (a.k.a. _fedizens_). Here's an example:

<p>
    <a href="https://fediring.net/previous?host=joelchrono12.xyz">←</a>
    <a href="https://fediring.net/">Fediring</a>
    <a href="https://fediring.net/random">???</a>
    <a href="https://fediring.net/next?host=joelchrono12.xyz">→</a>
</p>

Of course, webrings have been a thing for a long time, and some of the websites I came across also belonged to others, such as the [Yesterweb Ring](https://yesterweb.org/webring/) or the [Geekring](https://geekring.net).

So, yeah, I kinda want to join some more of these. I feel like I am acting like a kid or something. I never really got to live the golden years of the web and now that I've been blogging for 2 years and counting, I feel like I want to try to make up for it now.

Besides, the Fediverse is growing and I am hopeful a future where blogs also make a comeback in the mainstream gets to happen. Maybe I am too optimistic, but even so, if everything stays underground, that's fine by me too.

By the way, I decided to do a bit a thing. Since I recently opened my [blogroll](/blogroll/), I decided that if you have a website too and you feature my button there, perhaps your own blogroll (or maybe a special section for buttons?), you can send me yours and I'll do the same. Here's mine:

<a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank"><img style="opacity: 1; border-radius: 0px;" src="/assets/img/badges/joelchrono12.gif" caption="Set of buttons with a resolution of 88x31, can be found in my footer too"></a>

As long as your website is not illegal, of course. I will give a preference to Void Linux users, btw :P
