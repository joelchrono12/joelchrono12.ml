I can't concentrate on anything<br>
All day long, in front of a screen<br>
Be it the World Cup, or someone's rambling<br>
My notebook aside, empty and clean


Many things add up to trouble<br>
On the simplest task, I remain still<br>
My father knows, he sees through me<br>
I don't want to fail his will


While doing this very writing<br>
There's still work to do, I've seen<br>
Maybe after this I will be starting<br>
Be it homework, or a project, or a dream<br>
