After my switch to Pass,I got myself into a bit of trouble. For some reason, **I 
decided to make my passphrase 6 words long**, pretty safe, but slow to type for
me. I figured out how to change my passphrase and made it shorter, but I
couldn't get the idea of learning to type faster out of my mind.

After watching some YouTube videos, like [Ali Abdaal's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ArVtCQqQRE) 
video as an experienced typist with a speed of **~145 wpm**, as well as [Kalle
Hallden's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Qc_dzQTJ4) journey
trying to learn and get to at least 80 wpm, I decided to start learning once and for all.
I used to type with at least 5 or 6 fingers total, since I am a pianist, I was
already used to using many fingers, but I still lacked the proper technique of
using all my fingers, placing them in the home row and keeping them there. 

For my first test at [10fastfingers.com](https://10fastfingers.com) I did 19 wpm, which 
was terrible compared to my 55 wpm with my previous, *lackluster* ~~technique~~ mess. I 
started practicing finger placement and muscle memory on [keybr.com](https://keybr.com) 
and learned the positioning of every letter. 

Now, after three days, my current record is 52 wpm, which is quite great,
although my average is still on the low 40s. I am starting to catch up to my
previous speed, and I hope I manage to get to at least 80 wpm with more weeks of
practice. I still have a lot of trouble with punctuation, and my typing is not
that precise, but I hope that some more practice allows me to improve and also
to find my own style, since I also feel quite robotic sometimes. It feel pretty
cool to know I am using all of my fingers, and its also epic when somehow I get
one of those rushes where I get like 10 or so words typed without mistakes or
pauses, which are still quite common.

This was a bit of a shorter post, but I don't have a lot of time today, but I
still wanted to publish something soon enough, since my time could be even more
limited the following weeks.
