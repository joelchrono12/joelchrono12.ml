So, today I woke up a little later than usual, I tend to be awake by 7 am but I
woke up 26 minutes later (yeah, not that late).

After having some time for myself and eating some cereal, we went to a friend's
house to prepare some tamales. You will see, my church goes every Friday to two
local hospitals in our town, most of the time we only bring coffee and sandwich
for people who are outside, taking care of family members, visiting friends and 
waiting for news about the state of significant others.

This time we decided to make a special treat and prepare some *Tamales*, which is
one of the best forms of food the Mexican gastronomy has to offer, right behind
*Tacos al Pastor* if I do say so myself. Hand-made tamales are something everyone has to try if you come to Mexico someday.

After we got home me and my little sister watched the first three episodes from
Cobra Kai's 4th season, it started pretty strong, I can't wait to see the rest!

I write this right after finishing lunch time, we ate some *Tostadas de
frijoles y queso*, nothing too special, but they are always welcome in my belly
and I am
sure any non-Mexican would enjoy them a lot.

We aren't going to the hospital until a few hours from this being published but
right after that, we will have some Lasagna for dinner. It is not Mexican food,
but you can't have it everything, right? Let us give some credit to the Italian
cuisine I guess.

So, yeah, I am grateful with God for this year, it has been rough at times, but
we are still going, I am still going, and I pray next year God gives us all the
strength to keep it up, whatever comes next.

Have a Happy New Year everyone. This is day 71 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100DaysToOffload.com)
