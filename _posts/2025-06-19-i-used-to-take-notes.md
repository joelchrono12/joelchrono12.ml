Reading a blog post from [isa](https://tahimik.com) with her thoughts about [reading notes](http://tahimik.com/journal/read-your-notes-or-i-wrote-a-bot-to-post-my-notes-on-fedi) made me realize that I haven't really taken any, in years.

I remember very clearly how I used to be a complete Google Keep fanatic, late in high school and when starting university. It was awesome at the time, having instant access to all my notes on every device I logged into.

The app was quick and simple, the website was light enough. I used it for some time and I had a blast doing so. I recommended it to family members and schoolmates alike.

Eventually, ~~free and open source software ruined my innocence~~ I opened my eyes and realized Google was data mining every detail of my life, and I decided to look for alternatives.

Obviously, nothing was quite close to Keep's simplicity, but I ended up landing on [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/), which came quite close, and had Markdown support!

Joplin is pretty good to this day, and I used it for a long time for most of my time at University. 

It became a true life saver to take my notes during online classes, due to the covid pandemic. LaTeX support, which I used heavily for equations and formulas during math related courses for my mechatronics engineering degree, was a fantastic feature I used a lot at the time.

I took notes during lectures and lessons, while watching videos or searching information on websites and books online.

Once I learned to use Vim, and realized that Joplin has a Vim mode built-in, things were even better than before---although I decided to use Neovim as my external editor for it sometimes.

Eventually ~~suckless ideals ruined my innocence~~ I realized that Joplin was built on Electron, and it needed way too many resources for what it did, and so, I ended up not using it as much, eventually removing it from my devices.

Later on, I landed on [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs), and Emacs itself. I learned and fell in love with org-mode for a bit, and I remember using it for documentation during some of my programming courses, such as Embedded Systems, where I used [code blocks](https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-of-Code-Blocks.html) that could be executed directly from my org files, and it kind of rocked. 

I had the best notes in the whole class, and I am sure half of my classmates would not have passed if it wasn't for me. Let alone the Linux knowledge I already had, which made [playing around with raspberry pi's](/more/tags/raspberrypi/) a delight.

Of course, that very same suckless mentality made me feel like I didn't actually need all of that Emacs functionality just for some plain text files, and once University was over, it turned out that I really didn't, to be honest.

Nowadays, I barely take any notes, I still do, but only for the most basic tasks or things I don't want to forget.

I use *Note to Self* on [Signal](https://signal.org), and sometimes [Markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor), to write whatever notes I may need on my phone.

At work, I just use a plain text file and markdown format for any substantial info I may need to remember. I have dabbled with [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) a few times, since Markor supports it anyway.  I like how quick and simple it is, but I end up forgetting and falling back to writing whatever I want to remember.

Sometimes I feel like I should take way more notes for things, especially those I learn at work. I do have a file with some documentation I wrote for myself, but I haven't updated some things in a while. I feel like some day I'll end up shooting myself in the foot for not taking more notes at my workplace, but well, it's fine right now.
