Hey again, last month was quite great! I watched quite a bunch of stuff. Some of my highlights would be me getting a Kobo reader---with stats to be added to my device usage section. Reading *Dune*, starting the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime, listening to the *Callisto* sci-fi podcast, and of course watching *Dune: Part Two* on theaters!

## Podcasts

- **Sir Khan**: I've been getting back into Warhammer 40K lore and this Spanish podcast is just great, pure narrative and epic moments!
- **Trash Taste**: I listened to some great episodes that were quite fun. The one about conspiracy theories was hilarious.
- **Relatos de la Noche**: Horror stories narrated in Spanish, great voice and no ad reads in the middle make this good enough for me.
- **CALLISTO**: This was a short science fiction psychological horror drama that took me by surprise, I wish it was longer---it only has three episodes---but it was enjoyable and intriguing nonetheless.

## Manga

### In Progress
- **Monster**: I am very close to the end of this Manga and it just keeps getting more and more convoluted in a wonderful way, everything is coming together and flashbacks are bringing answers, and creating new questions. I hope the ending delivers, because this mystery is one of the best I've read.
- **Komi Can't Communicate**: Just read a few chapters for this, but they were more extras rather than actual plot, I hope more happens next.
- **Frieren: Beyond Journey's End**: After watching the anime I decided to catch up on the Manga too, and it is still absolutely great!
- **Dandadan**: After the anime trailer came out I decided to catch up on the Manga too, and it is still absolutely great!

### Finished
- **Remina**: This was a Junji Ito story, science fiction horror end of the world story about a wandering planet getting closer and closer to Earth, the mass hysteria and the fight for survival, and the absolutely insane last couple of chapters made this a really interesting read.

## Anime

- **Uncle From Another World**: This was quite a funny anime that has a bunch of isekai tropes, except that the character is a grown up adult and he just finished his journey and came back to reality. So, his nephew decides to turn him into a YouTuber. It was so funny I finished it in a day.

- **Frieren: Beyond Journey's End**: I watched the first 5 episodes and I ended up crying a couple of times, this is a beautifully done rendition that improves on the original material quite gracefully, I will keep watching.

- **Gurren Lagann**: I watched a couple more episodes of this one, it is still fun mecha battles and some interesting plotpoints just happened, gotta watch more.

## Books

### In progress
- **Dune**: I started reading this after Dune Part Two came out, I am at 69% of the story and I am loving it quite a lot, it really is as good as people say.
- **The Palace of Eternity**: I saw another YouTuber recommending this sci-fi space opera and I decided to read it alongside Dune, I was actually impressed by it and I hope I finish it soon.

### Finished

- **The Undefeated**: I was looking for something short to read and this came up, it was quite an interesting story that didn't quite feel like sci-fi in anything but background setting. More of a memoir, but good.
- **Tender is The Flesh**: A dystopia where animal meat cannot be ingested and cannibalism becomes accepted in society. It is more of a character driven story, and all the characters are kind of despicable, discretion is adviced.

## Movies

- **Dune: Part Two**: Absolutely fantastical movie, a must watch! I found it much better than the first part. The score, the cinematography, the color and everything was incredible. I liked it a lot.
- **Kung Fu Panda 4**: This was much better than I expected, but not better than the first two. I think it was rather short, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Po actually learned something instea
- **Damsel**: This was a Netflix movie that was picked at random, Millie Bobby Brown is on everything these days huh, good for her! The story was rather interesting, and darker than I expected. A princess tale turned nightmare.
- **The Lion King**: A true classic we watched as a family early on the month, still a masterpiece.
