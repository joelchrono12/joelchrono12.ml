Yet another month went by and I actually can't believe it, yet another year is flying by and [my birthday is just around the corner...](https://joelchrono12.xyz/#support-me). Regardless, what I did this month was hindered by many things, but I shall prevail.

So anyway, I've been very busy at my internship, is not really what I imagined, I've mentioned in my Mastodon account that it has nothing to do with Mechatronics, but I don't really mind, HR has been quite messy, but also very interesting and fun, I've done interviews and witnessed some interesting evaluations of people trying to get higher positions and such, I've also walked for hours putting flyers door by door in different cities around mine. Pretty much everyone of my fellow engineers mock me a little bit, but I have to admit I don't mind doing this at all since its not actually that heavy for me to do, I've been used to "hard" work like this for a while.

The part that I hate the most is the online engagement and recruiting, why? Because I have to use Facebook, but I'll stop for now, this is not about my job, but the media I've consumed lately!

# Podcasts

I listened to a total of 98 hours of podcasts. Thanks to my internship, I have like 3 hours everyday during commutes and stuff, I have listened to a bit more music lately, but also quite a lot of podcasts!

- **Into The Aether**: Once again this won with aroud 25 hours, its just quite a chill time to relax and listen to gaming shenanigans
- **Welcome To Night Vale**: This became my new podcast to listen while going to sleep, the lack of ads in between and the great voice of the host is simply amazing, the lore and stuff behind every episode is quite interesting, but it also does not matter that much to me, so I don't have to get hooked and stay awake, I just listen "Oh I recall this was in the background two episodes ago, it paid off!" and stay sleeping most of the time.
- **Behind the Bastards**: A new show I started about stories of bad people who did bad things, I listened to their series on Andrew Tate, since I had no idea why that guy was everywhere, and I gotta say its pretty interesting, I will check some of their more historical stuff soon enough
- **Sound Plus Doctrine**: This is a podcast for worship leaders and participants. This podcast has been very helpful and contains a lot of good tips and truths the bible says about music and worship in the church. I help my church by singing and playing the piano, helping guide the congregation to worship God.
- **The Vergecast**: I already knew about this podcast but never gave it a try, its actually a really decent show and some of their later episodes have been about the Fediverse and I found them really nice.

# Books

- **Eisenhorn: Xenos**: This book got in the backburner a bit, but I only have to read one more chapter, it got a bit more space warfare rather than mystery solving which turned me off just a little bit, but twists and turns keep me hooked still. Regardless, Manhwa took over this month...

# Anime

I didn't really watched any anime other than keeping up with Gurren Lagann but I didn't manage to finish it just yet, its gotten a bit too fanservicey which is annoying, but I'll try to watch until the end.

# Manga

- **Weak Hero**: This is a manhwa about a pretty smart guy who decides to face the bullies around him and build a reputation for himself, but this is not your regular power fantasy, every character gets quite deep and the protagonists are all quite interesting and complex, there are school gangs, corruption and a lot of fights in this, but it has managed to stay pretty interesting and the plot keeps going strong.

- **My Wife Is From a Thousand Years Ago**: Now this is a Manhua (a chinese comic), and its a pretty funny and wholesome rom-com about a guy who find a girl from a thousand years ago and helps her fit better into society, they get into pretty interesting situations and I get a little bit of diabetes while reading it, so there's that.

- **Sakamoto Days:** This picked up a bit more, the current arc seems to be about to end, still very fun action and comedy moments too.

# Movies

- **Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 3**: I don't need to say anything, a must watch.
- **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania**: I don't need to say anything, skip it.


# Device Usage

## Laptop Usage

I used windows for a while lately because of school homework, but on Linux this is what I did mostly. I used Linux for around 39 hours (you can tell I am not home as much huh).

- Firefox for 32 hours
- Alacritty for 4 hours
- PPSSPP for 2 hours

## Android Usage

I used my phone more often than I expected, for around 168 hours.

- Tachiyomi for 35 hours
- Newpipe for 29 hours
- WhatsApp for 25 hours
- Tusky for 12 hours
- Infinity for Reddit for 9 hours
- Fennec for 8 hours
- Facebook Lite for 6 hours

# Finishing toughts

As I've said before, work has gotten in my way a little bit more, but I've also been too lazy. I will try to catch up this month since I'm actually on vacation now. This is day 47 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100DaysToOffload.com)
