There are quite a few games that I have beaten long before I started this blog post. Most of them are pretty good, but most of the time I have only played them once.

I have to admit, I've been feeling rather nostalgic lately, yearning for what is familiar to me and eager to see if what I was enjoyed still holds up today, so, here are some games I kind of want to play again.

## Halo 3

It's been a while since I last played Combat Evolved and Halo 2, however, it's been even longer since I last gave Halo 3 a shot. I kind of want to try all of the games developed by Bungie once again, since it's been more than a decade since I last played them completely.

Halo 3 was the ultimate multiplayer experience for me back in the Xbox 360 days, during those times I used to go to the house of some friends and stay up late playing it over and over. Of course we made multiplayer matches but most of the time was spent on some chapters of the campaign that we just loved playing through. I think I'll buy the Master Chief Collection one of these days...

## Parasite Eve

I started playing this long before the pandemic started, I was in love with the setting and the style of its gameplay, I think it is one of my favorite implementations of Action and ATB combat ever, since you could move to position yourself, avoid enemy attacks and get closer to make your attacks stronger. It was a really fun system, however, there were many game mechanics I didn't understand regarding weapon upgrades, and many moments where I think I missed some things that could have helped me in some later sections of the game. 

Add to the mix that the game has aged in some aspects, the walking speed is atrocious and the save points can be hard to come by---although I love how they are represented by telephones, again, superb vibes--- and the PSP, while able to play the game perfectly, could not do save states or speed up the game, which is something I can do now with my Anbernic SP!

I want to revisit it and finally beat it properly! It should be a little easier with the nice things emulation lets you do.

## Metroid Dread

Maybe this one is the one that isn't really due for a replay, but I just *love* Metroid, going for another run would be so fun.

Metroid is just such an amazing series, infinitely replayable, all of the games can be optimized and be discovered in whole different ways. Somehow, I really got into completing 100% of it on my first playthrough, but now I want to just go for speed and efficiency and see what my completion time is.

Maybe I should just return to Hollow Knight instead though, but we'll see how things go.

## Chrono Trigger

Do I need to say more?

Chrono Trigger is my favorite videogame of all time. It's been 5 or so years since I last played it. I have watched a couple of full playthroughs on YouTube by some streamers in the last year or so, but I just want to experience that story for myself once again.

So far, I have only played the game on my PSP, emulating it with frameskip and some slowdowns whenever dialogue boxes showed up. If I'm honest, I didn't really mind at the time, it was barely noticeable.

I also played it in Spanish instead of English since I wasn't as familiar with the language yet, so it seemed reasonable, so this time I'll play the full game in English, it's not like I think a language is better or whatever, but just because now I can do it.

Will it hold up? most likely. Will it stop being my favorite? Probably not. Will I enjoy it? Absolutely.

## The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

However, Ocarina of Time is probably the game I want to replay the most. It was one of the first 3D games I saw, thanks to the power of emulation---I have shared that story [in a previous post](/blog/first-contact-with-emulation). This game is the first single player game I ever completed---with the use of guides, a cheap wired xbox-style controller and some version of Project 64, when I was still in high school.

I had a great time, and it was an accomplishment for me, playing it from beginning to end, after all the time I've known about it but did nothing to play it. This one I also played in Spanish because I barely knew English at at the time, kinda weird to think about that, huh. 

With stuff like the native PC recompilations that adds lots of improvements and QOL features, I think it's about time I give it another go. I *could* play it on Nintendo Switch Online too, I am still not set on what platform to choose since playing it portably might be just what I need. I sure do wish a complete remake of it was done for the Switch 2 soon to help me get over this dilemma.

## Final thoughts

I know that I really should be focusing on finishing new videogames right now, but I couldn't help but have some nostalgia lately, welp.

So, do you guys prefer move on and play new games, or do you usually revisit the classics and old favorites? I guess I do a little bit of both, why not?
