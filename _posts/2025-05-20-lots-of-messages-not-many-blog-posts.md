I just wrote about how much fun it is to [get emails and chat with people](/blog/reaching-out) lately! It really has been great! So much so that it has also limited the amount of time I dedicate to writing on my blog at all! 

I am no stranger to answering posts publicly instead than through private means, but I don't think that's the solution here, since some of those emails and chats have been less general and more personal.

What is the solution then? Of course, to write about the problem at hand!

This is it, I am definitely writing something right now, in this very moment, I'm typing, word by word, letter by letter, about this problem I have, where I'm spending way too much time writing but not blog posts, you see, but now this is a blog post, technically speaking, so, I did the thing!

Problem solved, I have achieved to write a blog post for everyone to enjoy, since this is exactly the kind of quality writing people expect to show up on their RSS feeds, am I right?
I also just want to write some more short stuff anyway, so this fits the bill perfectly fine too.

But hey, I can also keep going, keep blogging about blogging like pretty much everyone does!

...

In case you are wondering, I have been replying to most emails from my work computer. I type my reply on Notepad++ and once I'm done I transfer the text file to my phone. I would like to say I had a fancy method to tranfer the text from my locked down work laptop to my phone from the get go, but it was a bit meh at first.

I could not log-in to my proper email domain, but gmail still worked, so, at first I decided to write them there, let it save as a draft, check on my phone and copy paste to a proper reply email. After some extra edits, I hit send and called it a day.

Obviously, passing every email I wrote through Google first was not great, I didn't like it, especially those that were supposed to be encrypted...

Don't worry, I didn't send many this way, besides, some of the recipients use Gmail accounts anyway.

For some reason I forgot that stuff like `hastebin` exists, but as soon as I remembered it, I went that route instead, still not ideal but well, it is what it is.

How would you transfer a private conversation in this situation? I am not quite sure about what would be the best way. Installing encryption tools is a no-go here, I thought about just using a QR code generator from the text, but that has a limit, and I couldn't find a website that would turn the text into the QR, just a link to a not so private pastebin.

Whatever the case, I kinda think that going back to gmail might be the best move? it may be hard for people to stumble into one of those earlier hastebins, but not impossible...

Oh wait! I *think* I can password-lock them, right? I think there are some services that allow that, or maybe upload the text file to something like [send](https://github.com/timvisee/send-instances), you know, that might be the actual best move!

Or maybe I should stop writing personal emails at work. That's one area where messaging apps kind of win! But I like my emails...
