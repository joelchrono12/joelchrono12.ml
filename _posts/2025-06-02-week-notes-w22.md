I always feel kind of weird writing my weekly notes *right after a monthly summary*, that's why I wrote a mini post yesterday about a [collage making program](/blog/how-to-create-simple-collage-images/) of all things. It had been a while since I've written about a piece of software so, yeah. Anyway, back to the notes!

‚úçÔ∏è I wrote a lot of blog posts this week this week, so I almost don't have a lot to say about some things that happened. Still, **feel free to check out the posts from the past week** if you want to know more about what I've been up to writing-wise.

üé® I recently cleaned up my bedroom after changing some furniture, I relocated a bunch of stuff, and there was an old portfolio where **I found some old papers and homework** I did for middle school. Among them, there were poem drawings (calligrams), chalk art, and old graphics I used for homework reports. They were quite the trip down memory lane, and I might write about them in a separte post.

üíª Besides the desk and keyboard, **I recently bought a laptop stand too**. I didn't have enough space to rest my arms otherwise, because the desk was not deep enough. Even if it was, the laptop screen would end up too far behind. Now I can properly rest my arms and see the screen at my eye level, its a pretty fun time!

üéÆ My birthday is coming up, I will not order the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch, not yet. However, **I bought some physical Switch games** from Play Asia once again. I have played plenty of games these past few months and I don't feel any guilt whatsoever about it. By the time they arrive, I will have completed like 3 games anyway, because it's Play Asia. ~~Deal with it [Amin](https://benjaminhollon.com).~~

üßë‚Äçüíª While cleaning up my room, I also found my old laptop. I decided to turn it on just for giggles. As I opened it, the lid mechanism broke---it was already broken to begin with---and the screen got *even more* flimsy. However, I noticed it was running an old Fedora version. So, of course **I did a full upgrade from Fedora 37 to Fedora 42**, using their updater tool from the terminal. I might write a more complete post about it, but it was a pretty fun journey!

üåßÔ∏è There has been a lot of rain lately, and I pretty much have to walk on mud to get the bus stop. Thankfully, my father has been kind enough to give me a ride sometimes, so that has helped keep my shoes clean.

## Watching

**The Last of Us Season 2** - Watched the last episode, and it definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. A cliffhanger, seriously. In the game, you can keep playing. Here, I gotta wait three years or something. Ugh.

**Weak Hero** - Finished season 1 and ended up quite happy with it, I finally realized the story it was trying to tell, and I enjoyed it. The next season starts where the manhwa does, and we'll see how it goes. The first episode wasn't too bad.

**Death Note** - Started the second episode on a whim, the same kinda whim that made me watch the first one out of nowhere a few weeks ago. So far pretty good!

## Reading

**The Big Time** - Up to Chapter 9. Kinda got the story a little more so now I like it. We'll see how it keeps evolving. Wrote more thoughts on my monthly summary.

**Hunter x Hunter** - Up to Chapter 380. The new chapters finally started to grip me, it's almost like every arc of this manga is a whole different genre, and I absolutely love it.

## Gaming

**Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow** - I got a bunch of new power-ups and I feel practically invincible, I have to find the final boss or something at this point. I can turn into a bat and I am exploring every corner of the map looking for where to go, I love it.

**Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age** - Played it for like an hour, I will traverse the open sea soon, and explore more places. It should be super fun! However, this week I completed a few sidequests that were kinda wholesome, people exchanging letters and the like.

## Week Links

We got quite a bit of gaming related blog posts this time around, but I still kept some more personal and general ones to mix it up a little. I hope you enjoy!

### Blog posts

### Videos

- [Was the original Halo trilogy as good as I remember?](https://youtu.be/iA607kRYzR8) - a two hours long video essay about one of the videogame franchises I haven't covered much in my posts, but it significantly marked my childhood and teenage gears.
