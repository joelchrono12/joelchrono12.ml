At this point I don't know if I should bother explaining why I haven't blogged very often these past few months, I'll try this time around.

June was quite busy, it was my birthday once again, I bought a few nice things for myself, I got some nice gifts and I also went to the movies a couple of times. So here we go.

## Podcasts

- **Welcome to Night Vale**: This podcast became my favorite thing to listen to while sleeping, Cecil has one of the most relaxing voices ever, and the mood of this show is super loose yet kinda gripping, but I mostly get to sleep in around 10 minutes.
- **Trash Taste**: No introduction needed. I think I will start to note down *which* episodes I listened to like my [Lazybear](https://lazybear.io/posts/june-2023/) friend, that way I can explain a bit more, this time though I am too lazy.
- **Darknet Diaries**: I listened to the first few episodes of the backlog, with episodes like ASUSGATE, the VTech hack and such, the beginning of the show feels quite different to how its presented today, more serious, like a documentary.
- **Late Night Linux**: I should probaby mention I tend to listen to all the episodes being run by these guys, not just the main LNL episodes.

## Books

- **Eisenhorn: Xenos**: The first book of the trilogy is finally over, it was pretty good and entertaining, I have to say I got a little bit lost in the end but I got the main points and I am happy to have read at least one book without drawings or pictures in it this year. I hope to read some more.
- **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland**: In order to read more than one book this year I started with something that should be simple, I somehow have not read this book, but its fun and quirky and I hope to be done with it pretty quickly, it feels like a children's book but that's totally fine.

## Anime

- **Spy X Family Season 2**: I started the second season of this show and its super fun to watch with my siblings, a ton of laughter and wholesome moments, I actually got myself a t-shirt of this show with some panels featuring Anya lost somewhere in Mexico.

## Manga

- **Gyo**: Junji Ito got mentioned for a bit in Trash Taste, while talking about the horror genre in movies, anime and manga. The plot is about a bunch of sea life, from fish to sharks and squids, that come out of the sea and invade Japan, using some weird cyborg insect legs from unkown origin, to crawl around. Its so random and kinda gruesome, I just had to see how the story moved forward. Its such a weird thing that exists. It was entertaining, but kinda gross, I almost wanted to drop it and not even mention I read it, like most works of this mangaka.

- **Telework Yotabanashi**: I actually read this in May, but I forgot to mention it there. This is a pretty short romance manga about a couple of regular people that met thanks to working at home during the pandemic. Its sweet and pretty wholesome, I liked it.

- **Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible**: I actually read this in May, again. I completed this manga! It was quite fun, the friendship between the cast was super wholesome and it ended pretty well, its not very long either.

## Movies

- **Spider-man Across The Spider-verse**: This movie is a masterpiece, I love it, its great, the animation is insance, the action is top-notch, the cinematography is world class and I can't even begin with the writing of these characters, a couple of plot points felt a bit unrealistic, but this is awesome and I can't wait for the third movie.

- **The Flash**: This movie is not a masterpiece, but I think its fine, the animation sucked, the action is meh, the cinematography felt like a bunch of PS1 cutscenes and I can't even begin with the plotholes and non-sensical things that happen here, a couple of moments with Barry's mom where beautiful, but its not the best and I hope Gunn can make something good out of this universe. Henry Cavill should have stayed but anyways.

## Device Usage

I don't really use my laptop that much nowadays due to work, but here goes nothing...

### Laptop Usage

I used my laptop for around 46 hours total! At least on the Linux side.

- Firefox for 41 hours
- Alacritty for 2 hours
- Inkscape for 2 hours

### Android Usage

My phone on the other hand, got around 166 hours of screen time

- I used Facebook for 44 hours
- Whatsapp for 31 hours
- NewPipe for 18 hours
- Bromite for 9 hours
- Tusky for 9 hours
- Infinity For Reddit for 4 hours (RIP)

## Finishing thoughts

As you can see, I have to use Facebook a lot for work, this is because most of the recruiting I do is on social media and Facebook is king here in Mexico, not much I can do about it, other than sticking to the Lite edition to minimize its footprint on my device while also not making it a pain to use, which is sadly the case in the mobile browser version and the wrappers available.
