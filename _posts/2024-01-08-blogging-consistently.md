I've been meaning to write more often across the whole year, unlike last time. This is why I am going to willingly not post more than 4 blogposts per week, and I'll try to make around 2 most of the time. Of course some weeks will have to contain 3 just to stay within the timeframe of a year, but it must be done.

This is why I am still not done with the blogpost on many topics, such as my overview of 2023, or my favorite XYZ of the year. Besides, I am having a great time playing Ori And The Blind Forest on my Switch and that's keeping me a little busy. I'll probably finish it really soon so stay tuned for a review!

Still, I also want to go to sleep early today, hence the briefness of today's post, its more of a notice rather than actual content so I am sorry for that.

Don't worry, though, I am making use of the drafts feature in Jekyll to keep track of the ideas that pop into my head and also just write blogposts bit by bit over the span of a couple days, against my usual practice of just writing everything down in a single day. Some blogposts will still be written like that, and others will take some time, I'll just try to keep it simple, and stay consistent.
