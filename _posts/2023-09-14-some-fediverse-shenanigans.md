Among the many things I enjoy in life, scrolling through Mastodon may be one of the most mundane, but there are always new things to discover and enjoy, and that's what I like about interacting with the Fediverse as a whole, and there have been some events I wanted to write about before going to sleep today.

# New instance incoming

First of all, a friend of mine, [Benjamin Hollon](https://benjaminhollon.com/) has decided to host his own [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/) instance in the nearby future. Polymaths Social! He actually has an alpha instance running right now. At the moment submissions are closed but you can join the waitlist, [check it out!](https://waitlist.polymaths.social/). I actually have a [secondary account](https://alpha.polymaths.social/@joelchrono) there if you wanna see some extra me, by following from your Fediverse account.

GoToSocial is still pretty bare bones, and there are many features missing, the goals of GtS aren't exactly the same as Mastodon, its just another product that uses ActivityPub, so not everything will be implemented exactly as Mastodon users may expect, but the basics are being worked on and the speed and responsiveness is actually quite great.

# New blogs to follow!

I've also been discovering quite a few new blogs in town that are currently participating in [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com), such as [Noisy Deadlines](https://noisydeadlines.net/feed/), [Dustin](https://0xdstn.site/) and [82mhz](https://82mhz.net/).

I have enjoyed many of their recent blogposts and have also exchanged some emails with some of them, a few nice interactions on the Fediverse has shown me these guys may be pretty fun to have in my feed and maybe get inspiration from, as I also try to complete the challenge again.

I welcome them all with open arms and I hope they manage to complete the challenge, just like a few have done so before. May they succeed on their journey!

# New responsabilites to fulfill

Last but not least, I got promoted to the Moderator role at my main instance, [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org), I am even in [the team page!](https://hub.fosstodon.org/team) now, which makes it official. I shall rule with kindness and honor, and finally be able to show ~~NO MERCY TOWARDS ANYONE WHO DARES DEFY MY AUTHORITY.~~ ðŸ˜ˆ

Don't worry guys, I'm kidding, its quite a bit of responsability, and I'll try to fulfill my role to the best of my abilities. So basically, as long as you wear a Casio watch you are safe. What I really want to show, is that Fosstodon, despite its ups and downs, is still an instance worth being a part of (just [ask me](/contact) for an [invite!](https://hub.fosstodon.org/were-invite-only)). ðŸ˜‰


This is day 60 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
