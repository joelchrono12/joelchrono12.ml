Once again, let's go through the media I consumed this month, shall we?

This time I was on vacation so I don't really worry much about how I've spent my time. I should consider doing some more productive things, but meh.

# Podcasts

I can't really recall any particularly interesting podcasts.

I did listened to a couple of reviews from [They're Just Movies](https://theyrejustmovies.com/), specifically **Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness**, and **Lightyear**, which I haven't seen, but since I heard it ain't that great I wanted to see their opinions anyways. Also, they just released an episode on **The Thing**, which is my favorite horror movie, but I didn't listen to it in June.

Other than that I listened to a couple [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/119/) episodes, **Hot Swaps** and **Hot Wallets**, which were really interesting.

MKBHD's [Waveform podcast](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/waveform-the-mkbhd-podcast) also had some great episodes, I liked the one with Tom Scott as guest, it was really interesting.


# Books

Still pretty much none, there is a reason I joined a Bookwyrm instance named [Bookrastinating](https://bookrastinating.com) lol.

# Manga

I started and finished [The Boxer](https://anilist.co/manga/119174/The-Boxer/), this one is actually a manhwa (south Korean manga pretty much), like Solo Leveling, which I've mentioned before. As the name implies, its about boxing, but its so much more. I've not read a lot of sports manga, but I've seen those stories in movies and series all the time. This one is different, it takes the stereotypes of the genre and gives them a really unique twist. Every character is well written and has a reason to be there, and the plot is simply fantastic. I don't want to spoil anything, if you are interesting in reading or watching anything I did during June, this is it.

I also finished [Horimiya](https://anilist.co/manga/72451/Horimiya/), which is pretty much the ideal Rom-com manga with characters that actually make decisions that make sense and have a realistic behavior when facing X or Y situations. That does not mean it does not have its wholesome, funny and romantic moments though, now I understand why its considered among the best of the genre, although I still have some others to read.

Also I gave [Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou](https://anilist.co/manga/30004/Yokohama-Kaidashi-Kikou/) a read, It seems like a nice slice of life in a pretty unique kinda dystopian, yet hopeful setting. I've only read like 5 chapters though.

I am pretty much up to date in other manga like Kingdom, Sakamoto Days and One-Punch Man, which is going through a fantastic arc right now, you should catch up to it if you don't wanna miss it.

I am still reading Alita, I only read a couple chapters this month though.

# Anime

I finished **SPY Ã— FAMILY**, it really enhanced the manga to new levels, the animation was fantastic and it was really fun watching it with my sister. It's pretty family friendly too, which is nice.

I am also watching  the 2nd season of **Komi Can't Communicate**, I am at chapter 8 so far.

# TV Shows

I watched the 4th season (Part 1) of **Stranger Things**, its really good, if Season 2 made you leave and Season 3 was not good enough for you, I think this one may be just enough to pull you back to Hawkins. I will be watching the second half this month, I hope the quality stays high.

I also watched **Kenobi**, and enjoyed it quite a lot, but there are some issues with the plot and writing. The last two episodes get real good though, if a bit fan-servicey, but that's what I am here for!

# Movies

I watched **Jurassic World Dominion** and it was a really fun popcorn movie where I just shut my brain off and enjoy whats happening on screen. I liked it.

Also, **Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness**. I really enjoyed what Sam Raimi did with the material he was given, its messy at some points but its so fresh and different that I didn't really mind, there are some moments where I thought "*they could have handled that better*" and some others where I was like "*How did they let him do that in a Marvel movie?*", it was really cool.

# Music

I kinda didn't use Spotify nor my own music server. I found [URL Radio](https://github.com/jamal2362/URL-Radio) on F-Droid and discovered some radios with Ambient Space music and LoFi, since I listed mostly while sleeping (with a sleep timer of course) or writing.

# Screen Time

Alright so lets go with some facts about my phone usage. 

- I used Newpipe for 48 hours.
- I read on Tachiyomi for 38 hours, so I guess it balances out with YouTube.
- I played Brawl Stars for 8 hours, I am trying to complete this season.
- I used Infinity for 15 hours and Tusky for 14, oops.

Since I got a new laptop I didn't install ActivityWatch yet, but its pretty much just Firefox and Vim as always.

# Finishing up

So that was the month of June, I consumed quite a lot of content this time, I still haven't put much time into reading books, again.

Anyways, vacations are great, I just have to find another sci-fi universe to get myself invested into, so give some recommendations if you think I might like them.
