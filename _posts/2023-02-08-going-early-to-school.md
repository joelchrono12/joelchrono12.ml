So our teacher let us know that today we would not have class because of reasons I already forgot, just like I forgot everything about the announcement until I had spent 10 minutes alone in the classroom listening to [an episode](https://intothecast.transistor.fm/episodes/11488b1c-da49-4455-b92b-6a150a2d8a02) of Into The Aether.

Therefore, I decided to go to the computer lab on my University and start writing this blog, since I brought my laptop and everything, I'll write whatever comes to my mind.

# Getting into Warhammer 40K

I think I mentioned it in a toot a few days ago, but I recently got kind of interested in the Warhammer 40K lore. Its a franchise I had never heard of until an episode of the [Animators React](https://youtu.be/enU6nyyNR4I) series, that showcased a fan animation of it, which sparked the first seeds that only now just flourished. A friend who is really into the games and lore introduced me to [Sir Khan](https://www.youtube.com/@SirKhan), a fantastic YouTube channel __in Spanish__ that makes absolutely amazing videos about the lore. I started listening from the start and ended up super invested on them. I actually cried because of how epic the story is, especially when I listened to his video on [The Horus Heresy](https://youtu.be/Wp7Rrf7g7E8). I still have a long way to go, but this universe is __so awesome__ and there are so many books to read.

I already read a short novel which was quite hooking (_Crusade_ by Andy Clark), but I am considering reading one of the many series of books within the franchise. I believe I will go with the Gaunt's Ghosts series, but we'll see.

# Adding web buttons

I was testing out the size of my website and noticed my logo was in PNG format, I decided to just use the svg file alone since it should be lighter to load and all. I also added some 88x31 px buttons, like those that can be found in some old websites and the like. I got the inspiration from [BugsWriter's website](https://bugswriter.com), although I already had some, I just found some more online and added them too. I think I first saw them in [The Privacy Raccoon](https://privacyraccoon.tk/) though. I even made my own button for [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org), because I love Void Linux.

I am sure there are still tons of buttons like this in some neocities websites and the like. I actually went to [Wiby.me](https://wiby.me), a classic search engine for classic websites to look for some random sites. It was fun!

In case you want to use some yourself, you can check [this website](https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/), no search bar though.

# Finishing up

Its now a matter of 20 or so minutes for my next class to begin, I think I will go get something to eat and publish this as always now. The episode I was listening to is going to end in 15 minutes or so. My arms are starting to hurt because the seats are too low (or the desks are too high, I guess) so I will publish this and take a break. Now you have an idea of how long I take to write posts like this one. You're welcome ;)
