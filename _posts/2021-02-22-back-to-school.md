Well I got some free time, since I am typing this after finishing up all of my homework, I am doing this blog in a quick and dirty way because I just want to go to sleep after a day of learning not only about the topics we will see during the semester, but also trying to find a new, more minimal and simpler workflow when it comes to my homework.

I have decided to use Markdown and Pandoc to deliver both assignments I had today, and I am quite impressed with the results. I watched a few videos about how to do some stuff like formatting, using Beamer to do slide shows and that kind of thing. I really think I might be able to not need to use any Office Suite, if I manage to learn enough LATEX to do my math equations and those problems.

One of my teachers is also quite a Linux user, he roasted Windows quite hard in the first class we took, mentioning how their users need to look up for software on websites and how superior the FOSS philosophy is, he even mentioned how bad is Chrome compared to Firefox.

Anyways, it looks like this year could be not so terrible at all, it's only a matter of time to see how the rest of teachers are like in the following week. I might talk more about my school workflow this weekend.
