Since I started doing [week notes](/more/tags/weeknotes) now, these posts do not require to be as in-depth, because most of my thoughts on the games and media I watched, I already shared, however I will still list everything I watched, read, listened and enjoyed in this one single blog post because I want to.

## Podcasts

This month was quite regular when it comes to my podcast listening. Also to save you time, I wil use the ✨ emoji when new or uncommon stuff shows up in my media.

- ✨ __The Nerd Nest__ for 1.8 hours, this is a new one! I wanted to give a listen to their Game Awards episode and liked it.
- __Welcome to Night Vale__ for 20 hours. Lots of sleeping listening to this podcast for once, I think I forgot to setup the sleep timer one day.
- __Retro Game Time Machine__ for 7 hours. They've been doing some very interesting games lately, including Super Mario RPG!
- __Dungeons and Daddies__ for 5.4 hours. I finally finished a couple of episdoes, but I'm still behind on the 3rd season.
- __Into The Aether__ for 5.2 hours, because of course I listen to them!
- __The Rest is History__ for 3.8 hours, I listened to some of their episodes on 1968, awesome stuff.
- __NPC: Next Portable Console__ for 2.4 hours, just regularly scheduled episodes.

## Gaming
- ✨ __Hollow Knight__: This is my current focus now that I finished PoP, and I want to beat it alongside my friends who are trying it too.
- ✨ __Balatro__: I returned to this for a bit to play with friends and talk about the best poker plays and jokers to try out.
- ✨ __Lumines Remastered__: I did a single run of Lumines and I managed to get into my own top 10 runs, but didn't beat my PB yet.
- ✨ __I Was a Teenage Exocolonist__: I played this game for like 5 hours last week and advanced the story quite a bit.
- __Dragon Quest XI__: I continued playing this game for a bit more, I am really liking it but it has been displaced a little bit.
- __Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown__: I finished this game, I love it, check my review of it.
- __Nintendo Switch Sports__: I play this with friends and my sibling sometimes and it's super fun!

## Books
- __Caliban's War__: I started this book and I'm on chapter 20 of it, I am really liking it, it's the sequel to _Leviathan Wakes_ and it's just as good so far.
- __Leviathan Wakes__: I finished this book, check my review early this month.
- __Black Easter__: I finished this book, liked it a bit less but it was still quite good.

## Manga
- __JuJutsu Kaisen__: I've read a lot of JJK, I am beyond the season 2 of the anime and it gets so good.
- __DanDaDan__: I am loving this and I still don't watch the anime but I've seen some shorts and I might watch it soon.
- __Kingdom__: I read a couple chapters, always a joy and super epic.

## Device Usage

I am using my phone too much, and my laptop not enough, I have uninstalled some apps recently and I hope that helps, I will probably unsubscribe from YouTube Premium honestly, and cut on my messaging as well.

### Laptop
I used my laptop for 71 hours
- Firefox for 52 hours
- Alacritty for 8 hours
- Signal for 1 hour

### Phone
I used my phone for 221 hours
- WhatsApp for 53 hours
- YouTube for 43 hours
- Signal for 24 hours
- Bottled for 18 hours
- Tusky for 14 hours
- Firefox for 10 hours
- Discord for 9 hours
- Mihon for 8 hours

### E-Reader

I read for 17 hours, gotta go for 30 next time.
- Caliban's War for 7:38 hours, 485 pages
- Black Easter for 3:14 hours, 156 pages
- Leviatan Wakes for 5:10 hours, 333 pages

## Finishing thoughts

I made a lot of blog posts because of [#WritingMonth](https://writingmonth.org), not my best streak at all, but still filled with variety and the start of my week notes as well.

I think I will try to focus on reading more, it's been a little difficult to balance out my gaming and my reading, but I think there's a way, maybe calendar blocking or something like that? I don't know. Should I plan this out some more? maybe. For now, it is now December, and I'll see what this month brings, lots of gifts I hope!

This is day 96 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
