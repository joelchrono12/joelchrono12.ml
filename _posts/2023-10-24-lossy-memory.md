Alright, I think it's finally time for me to write a review of my most expensive purchase ever. Yes, I'm talking about my Nintendo Switch!

Wait a minute, I already wrote [a review about it](/blog/nintendo-switch) this very same month...

I actually completely forgot about it, but I did remember I took a picture of my Switch, and then had this deja vu feeling, eventually realizing I had already done this before.

Now I don't know what to believe, how many of my blogposts have been about the same thing multiple times at this point? It's kind of intriguing, but don't worry, as far as I know I haven't repeated a blogpostâ€”at the moment.

I am a little glad that this happened, since I didn't know what to write about, and now I get to do a few paragraphs about this.

Obviously, I have wrote about some common themes such as Linux, FreshRSS or my PSP, but each post usually focuses on a different aspect of them.

However, I can't help but feel that maybe I'll reach a point where I'll end up writing about exactly the same topic with different words and I won't even realize.

I do remember hearing somewhere that writing about the same thing in different times can help to summarize the main points of an idea or an essay and such. Maybe every iteration will be just a little better than the previous oneâ€”or devolve into madness...

Maybe in 2 years I'll be writing about forgetting what I've written about and I'll reach a different conclusionâ€”but that's the job of future me.

Hmm, it's weird, I had a clever way to wrap this upâ€”but I forgot.
