I was challenged by [Mike Sass](https://shellsharks.com/bqc-ten-pointless-facts) to answer these pointless things, so, here they are!

## Do you floss your teeth

I only remember to do this like once ever 4 or so months, I honestly have never had big problems because of it, I think. Like, I've never had teeth removed or caries or any sort of damage done to them. Other than regular wear after all the years they've served me, I guess.

## Tea, coffee, or water?

I drink water the most, I have nothing against drinking tea, and I always do so if my stomach or throat are dying in pain.

Coffee, that's something I really like! However, I only drink it if it's available. That is, if my dad prepares some in the coffee maker, or if workmates invite me a cup. Of course, if there's instant coffee in some event, I will prepare one for myself.

I rarely drink more than a cup a day, and I don't do it every day, but everytime I do, it's quite enjoyable.

## Footwear preference?

As of now, my favorite shoes are the "Adidas Forum Low CL Cordura Black"

I find them pretty comfortable, and I absolutely don't care at all about their looks. They are a pretty basic design, and while originally black, the suede has changed its color over time to a more dark gray with a slight blue-ish hue, which I honestly really like. They work and I can wear them all day without issues, they fit me perfectly fine.

## Favourite dessert?

Carlota de Limón, it's a fantastic dessert which is pretty popular in Mexican culture. Maria cookies are a part of every Mexican's life, and they are the essential ingredient of Carlota is. I will never get tired of eating it, and I will always want more.

It's quite simple and traditiona, and it's always better when it's eaten right out of the fridge. Simple perfect for summer, and every other season as well.

## The first thing you do when you wake up?

Read! my local church has a Bible study early in the morning, I join a phone call and we all read a bible chapters and talk about it, then we pray together, and continue the day! I have managed to keep it going throughout the whole year somehow, which has been nice, a couple of misses, but never for long.

## Age you’d like to stick at?

I am pretty happy with my current age, but somewhere in the range of 28-35 is probably the sweet spot for me.

## How many hats do you own?

I have one sun hat, and four baseball caps. I barely wear anything though.

I used the sun hat during my time as an intern in the HR recruitment department, where I would walk for hours leaving fliers door by door, or to people on the streets. It's weird to think about how that happened almost 2 years ago now.

## Describe the last photo you took?

The last photo I took is a shot of Dragon Quest XI, where I (the protagonist of the game) am about to go inside a Casino. The roof is red, same as the carpet in the floor, it looks real classy, but for some reason the Casino's front sign is super colorful and kinda disrupts the elegance of the whole sorroundings.

## Worst TV show?

I don't think I've truly watched a horrible TV show, so I can't really come up with anything I actually completely hate.

If we are talking about a season though, The Flash became unwatchable for me after season 5 or so. I only kept going because my sister still liked it, but everyone stopped after season 7. I just couldn't take it any longer.

## As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?

I wanted to work with robots! I think that's why I ended up as a mechatronics engineer, although I have to say, I am much more of a programming fan rather than dealing with sensors and actuators.
