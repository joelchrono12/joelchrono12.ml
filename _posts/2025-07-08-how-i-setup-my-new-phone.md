I don't know what it is, but I really enjoy having a new phone to configure. I recently acquired the Nothing Phone 3(a) to replace my [broken Xiaomi Mi12T Pro](/blog/2025-w27/#new-phone-who-dis), and it's been awesome.

As soon as I turned it on, I knew it would be quite a treat to my eyes. The clean android experience that NothingOS has to offer is something I was missing since I had to switch to Xiaomi's HyperOS because of my [Poco F4 failing on me](/blog/my-phone-scared-me-(again)/)

Every time, it feels like a challenge, but one of the cool ones, where I try to stay as minimal as possible, installing as few apps as I can, logging it to the essential accounts only.

That threshold grows every time though, becoming a bit of a behemot, as I have to install a banking app, or as I log into another email address. But I still try, I slowly realize what programs I use less, and which ones I don't really care about that much. I delete accounts for some videogame or some random service I no longer use. And at the same time, I add a new more grown-up account, for whatever alternative shopping website I choose to try instead of Amazon or the big online shops in my country.

So, setting up my phone and what's on it went more or less like this:

- Do the basic Android setup, don't login to anything and say no to tracking and such
- Go to Settings, developer options, set animation speed to 0.5
- Enable 3-button naviation
- Go to Chrome (the Android default, unfortunately), look up [Droid-ify]() and install
- Via Droid-ify, install:
	- KeepassXC for password management
	- Syncthing-Fork to sync files between devices
	- Fennec to browser the web
	- Gramophone for local music
	- Metrolist for YT Music
	- Tubular for YouTube
	- Otraku for Anilist
	- Fossify Gallery, Contacts and Calendar
	- Stealth for Reddit
	- Binary Eyes for barcodes
	- Conversations for XMPP
	- Sunup for Unified Push Notifications
	- Markor for Markdown files
	- Material Files for file management
	- Nextcloud for file storage and DAV sync
	- DAVx5 to sync contacts and calendar events from Nextcloud
	- OpenKeyChain to import my keys, and configure K-9 Mail encryption
	- Tusky for the Fediverse
    - Arcticons because line-based icons rule.
    - KISS Launcher is best
- Set Arcticons as the system-wide icon pack (NothingOS lets me do that!)
- Setup KISS Launcher as default by importing the configuration (a json string, super portable!) on my new phone
- Setup Syncthing and sync my "Backups" folder, which contains my Keepass database, and backups for AntennaPod, Tubular, Threema, K-9 Mail, among other apps
- Sync other folders via the same method, for pictures, music, etc.
- Restore app backups where possible.
- Via Fennec, download and install some apps:
	- ActivityWatch for app usage tracking
	- Mihon to read manga
    - Aniyomi to watch anime
	- SimpleScrobbler to scrobble to Listenbrainz
- Login to certain websites such as Backloggd, Letterboxd, Bookrastinating, Anilist, GitHub, etc
- Set up an empty Google account because I need Play Store nowadays
- Disable sync, and as many things as possible
- Via Play Store, install:
	- Banking apps because I'm an adult now
	- Signal and WhatsApp, migrating data from previous phone or backup
	- Steam because of Steam Guard
    - Proton Mail which I use for some things
    - YouVersion Bible because it's the only one with all the versions I use
	- Snapseed because it's still the best photo editor
	- Shopping apps because I am irresponsible
	- Nintendo Parental Controls to track my Nintendo Switch usage
	- Brawl Stars, the only online game remaining
	- Discord, because communities there are nice sometimes
- Delete or disable bloat, in this case it was already minimal, thankfully

And everything is pretty much done!
