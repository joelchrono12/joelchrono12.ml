I did it again! I managed to publish 100 blog posts in the span of a year!

I've done it twice before, but never during the span of a single calendar year. In fact, I finished a few days earlier before it ends!

Lots of posts were done this time, and the variety was pretty wild, but at the same thing, I did more reviews, sumaries and even started doing weeknotes as well, basically, posts with a set format including:

- 12 [monthly summaries](/more/tags/monthly)
- 12 [book reviews](/more/tags/book)
- 5 [weeknotes](/more/tags/weeknotes)
- 9 [videogame reviews](/more/tags/game)
- 4 [blog replies](/more/tags/response)
- 3 [gadget reviews](/more/tags/gadget)
- 3 [WIMTs posts](/more/tags/what-interested-me)
- 1 [movie review](/more/tags/movie)
- 5 [blog updates](/more/tags/jekyll)

Of course, I also wrote many other blog posts about multiple things or interests!

January was pretty chill, with some blog posts looking back at 2023, and some book and videogame reviews. [Blogging consistently](/blog/blogging-consistently) is the only blog post I wrote that wasn't about media or memories, but it's still about the fact I didn't write as much throughout the month.

February was much more varied, [I cleaned up my RSS feed](/blog/inbox-zero-but-rss/), I was [into analog media](/blog/checking-off-boxes-on-paper/) for like a week, I finally [found a song after 10 years](/blog/finally-finding-the-song/), and documented how I [bought a fake Casio](/blog/how-i-found-out-my-casio-watch-was-fake/). And of course, [I was done with university](/blog/university's-over/), and reflected on that for a bit. Quite a lot of good personal posts!

On the contrary, March was kind of empty, just reviews and links, and one website update where [I played around with Flexbox and CSS](/blog/website-changes-flexbox-and-stuff/).

April was filled with reviews as well, but I still wrote about [friendships at work](/blog/work-and-friends) and [my phone screen](/blog/my-home-screen-2024), I do have to highlight my review of [Dune](/blog/dune) because it was one of my longest pieces of writing on the site and its more than just a book review, if I do say so myself.

During May, I participated in [WeblogPoMo2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024), writing 22 blog posts during May, there is a lot of variety, some of my highlights would be my post on [early computing memories](/blog/early-computing-memories) and my [first contact with emulation](/blog/first-contact-with-emulation). I also wrote about setting up game covers for my Miyoo Mini Plus, creating my own theme, converting save file formats from my PSP to PS1, and all of that mumbo jumbo.

During June I was a kind of silent, but I wrote about [more emulation memories](/blog/more-emulation-memories), July was also very dry, but I did my review of the [miyoo mini plus!](/blog/miyoo-mini-plus-review)

August was lazy as well, in fact, I wrote about [getting lazy on account management](/blog/getting-lazy-on-account-management) and just the usual other stuff.

All the previous months were almost the bare minimum, monthly summary, a review of some kind and one more personal blog post.

In September my output rose a little more, when I wrote my review for the [Anbernic RG35XX SP](/blog/the-gba-experience-i-wanted), and I also started to [buy more physical games](/blog/physical-game-collecting-spree), my highlight of the month would be my ramble about [explaining hobbies](/blog/explaining-hobbies-is-weird).

I kept the engine running the rest of the year! October had lots of interesting posts, starting out with a review of [Transformers One](/blog/an-awesome-movie-to-sell-toys%E2%80%94transformers-one/), a movie! that's something I don't do often at all, but that was a great piece of animation that I felt everyone should watch. Still, my favorite post was probably my response about [writing as a natural part of the day](/blog/writing-as-a-natural-part-of-the-day)

In November, [Writing Month](https://writingmonth.org) begun, I didn't have enough steam to go as full as I did in May, but I still managed to write 11 blog posts, consisting of 2 book reviews, a monthly summary and 4 weeknotes, also a response to a really great blog about [how texting changed how we socialize](/blog/when-texting-destroyed-social-investment/) and a challenge to [stop myself from buying games](/blog/games-to-beat-before-buying-more/). My favorite post is the one about [the lack of finishing thoughts](/blog/no-finishing-thoughts) at the end of an article.

And now, we are at the end! December is not going to be that much active, but I already have some ideas in my head. I already wrote [my gaming recap](/blog/gaming-recap-2024), but I also want to make the same for manga, podcasts and books, I am already writing the latter. Of course, the general recap should come too, but maybe next year. And the review of my last read book, Caliban's War, has to release before I publish my reading recap! Lots of things are coming soon.

Writing is not a challenge for me anymore, but I like being part of this one since it gives me a reasonable goal every year to keep this blog going, this is my third time now, good stuff!

This has been day 100 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com).

Challenge over.
