So, back then I didn't know any better. Blogs were not really something I was very familiar with. MSN Messenger was still around and it was my favorite (or perhaps the only) way to instantly chat with friends.

As a grumpy young adult, I tend to be annoyed when kids only want to be on their phones playing Roblox or Fortnite. But then I remember that one of my favorite things I liked to do when I was younger, was playing Club Penguin. It was a really fun game at the time. I remember it quite fondly. I probably would have played it in my phone if it was possible too. I was quite happy.

I loved it so much that I started to look for tips and tricks online. Most of them were on English, especially on YouTube, which was quite a shame. Besides, back then a lot of them were trolls or fake. Just like today you see *"Easy way to get more Robux"*, or *"How to max your account fast"* and such types of videos on modern games today. *Nothing is new, everything already existed*.

At least when you paid for stuff you didn't have to gamble to get what you actually wanted...

So anyways. All I could find in Spanish back then, were blogs hosted on [Blogger](blogger.com), Google's blogging platform. Of course, I didn't care much about who owned what and the like. All I know is that reading from those blogs I started to learn about coupons and secrets I could use to get free stuff. Which was awesome for little me.

Eventually, I decided to start my own Blog in Blogger, where I pretty much just copied posts from other websites. 

This is actually the reason I started to learn a bit more about computing, I did my own logo and stuff, using Photoshop, still, pretty cool back then. I tried out a bunch of Blogger themes, tried to recreate some functionality and yes, I even tried to add adds. I am so sorry.

I eventually made some other sites on Blogger, one about Origami, a couple for School projects. But eventually on later years I deleted them most of them. Maybe they are still on some Google data center, wandering around in the cloud.
