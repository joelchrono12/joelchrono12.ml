I was already working on a different post to write about and then I realized that I haven't even shared my summary for February, so here I am typing this now. Somehow it's March already, what in the world?

## Podcasts

I listened to...

- **Into The Aether** for 27.4 hours. Listened to every episode released this month, and a few more from the backlog. Every Wednesday is a bit of a treat, it's almost the extra push I need to finish the work week at this point. Fanstastic show.
- **Welcome to Night Vale** for 11.6 hours. I no longer sleep listening to it because I made a music playlist to play every night instead! Still listen at the gym and some nights though.
- **Retro Game Time Machine** for 9.9 hours. Always a joy to listen to, they did a top 5 games of the year as well which I listened here and there during the month.
- **Eye of the Duck** for 5.9 hours. They did a series on alien invasion movies, their episode of *The War of the Worlds* was great but I was a bit annoyed they barely mentioned the book at all!
- **Dungeons and Daddies** for 4.3 hours. I lost the thread a little bit and I haven't had as much time to focus on it sadly, still lots of fun.

## Movies

- **Mufasa**. A prequel to *The Lion King* we went to watch because it was free, not as bad as I expected actually, but it would've been better animated.
- **Godzilla x Kong**. Fun time, Godzilla is pink and Kong has a metallic fist now, turn off brain, big monster fight, cool.
- **Back in Action**. Typical Netflix spy movie where they hide and retire and have kids and they are on the run now. The kid character was cool, he enabled 2FA on his devices.
- **Shrek 2**. Shrek 2 is the perfect sequel, the teaser for Shrek 5 sucks.

## Reading

- **The Space Merchants** I read to chapters of the book, I like it and wanna read more, cool sci-fi stuff with a guy who is bad since he works in an advertising company that basically runs the world now. They wanna colonize Venus and make people want to go there with ads, even though it's a wasteland and barely worth it, sounds familiar?

## Manga

- **Hunter x Hunter** is all I've been reading this month, I don't think I touched any other manga this month. I am in chapter 328 now, which means I also got to read the *Chimera Arc Ant*, and that was really one of the most intense and subverting arcs I have ever read in a manga. I really don't think *JuJutsu Kaisen* compares at all, they are in completely different leagues. All the previous arcs were great as well, but *Chimera Ant* really surprised me. 10/10 you should read it from the beginning.

## Anime

- **Mashle: Magic and Muscles** is a fun time, it's a total parody of Harry Potter merged with the style of One Punch Man. A ridiculously strong guy with zero magic abilities joins a magic academy and tries to become the top student there, a "Divine Visionary." It's pretty funny and has some cool action sequences, it doesn't take itself very seriously which I like, it's a nice time.

## Gaming

Do I really have to write about every single game I have been playing? It's just too many, check my weeknotes for this month and you'll see, I will list most and just write about a couple others.

### Finished

- **TOEM**. This was a short little game about taking pictures and fullfiling tasks given to you by people, which grant you stamps that let you travel to other places and take more pictures. The goal of the game is to travel to a mountain and take a picture at the top to show your grandma.

    It was a charming cozy game with a nice artstyle and music, I played it on my laptop this time around, and it was a very nice time.

- **God of War: Chains of Olympus**. This is a game I started ages ago on my PSP, and since I have been doing a lot of PSP gaming recently, I returned to this game and got to the end of it. Honestly, a fantastic handheld experience that is still impressive today.

### Ongoing

- **Dragon Quest XI**: I played a bunch of this early in the month but lost a bit of steam simply because other games showed up. I am loving it every time I play it and I can't wait to return to it in March.
- **Ys: The Oath in Felghana**: I made a bunch of progress on this game and I'll definitely beat it in March, I only have one dungeon left so I figured I would try other games in the mean time. The combat, the story, the music, everything just works and it's like, the quintessential action rpg experience! Except flying enemies.
- **Triangle Strategy**: I returned to this game after ages late in February, and I like it, it just has too much story bits and not enough action moments where I can play and do fun stuff. I like it much more now and have gotten some new characters to play with, I will try to make progress and experience more battles.
- **Brave Story: New Traveler**: Started it on a whim after it was mentioned on ITA, I had already played it before but I didn't even get to the gameplay part. Turns out it plays like Dragon Quest does which is, like a traditional turn based rpg. It's simple and it plays great and it's not super unfair or difficult, I'm liking it.
- **Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade**: I beat a few chapters this month and it's been pretty fun to just open my SP, play a few turns and then do other things, it's a great gameplay loop that gets interrupted everytime I have to start a new battle and get ready, that's the only bit I dislike which it's a bit weird honestly. Still, good time.
- **UFO 50**: A friend gifted it to me in the middle of the month and I have played like 4 games of it, it's fun and super interesting but didn't get into it as much as I'd hoped. I want to clear some other games before I return to it. Super promising though.
- **Dungeon Antiqua**: A retro dungeon crawler that looks like Final Fantasy, enjoyable, fun and quick. I haven't really played a lot of it yet, only an hour or so, but I like the simple gameplay loop and it plays just great on my Anbernic SP, since it's a python game!
- **Super Mario Bros Wonder**: I returned to this one day on a whim and completed the Lava world before Bowser's final world, I advanced a few levels too and completed some with missing collectibles. Just a great time.
- **The Legend of Heroes:  Trails in the Sky**: I started this over on PC and really like some of its QOL features, but I decided to continue on my PSP and made some progress in a few ongoing quests. I should return to it but other games kept me busy.
- **Dredge**: Played a couple hours so far, interesting game and mechanics, weirdly relaxing yet scary. Playing it on my Laptop too hoping it captures me like TOEM did, even if they are totally different genres. I will play it a bit more soon.
- **Batman: Arkham Asylum**: I had this on Epic Games and played it via Heroic, it was a bit hard to get it too run because but no problem once I figured it out, I wanted to see how good it was and I think I will play it more later in the month.
- **Mario vs Donkey Kong**: When I don't feel like playing a JRPG, Mario vs Donkey Kong is there, a couple levels a couple times a week! Super fun and simple puzzle platforming.
- **Ridge Racer 2**: After the great time I've had with Ridge Racer, the sequel turns out to be the same game but with more tracks to choose from. So I decided to hop on to this one and keep going!
- **Minecraft**. Played it early in the month with some friends in our personal server, simply Minecraft.
- **Ember Knights**: Returned to this late in the month with a new DLC with some new enemies and boss fights, doing 4 player co-op was very fun, we got to the very end but the final boss beat us. We unlocked some new power-ups though which was nice, will probably play it again tomorrow.
- **Axiom Verge**: Only played like 40 minutes and I'm struggling to figure out if I should buy this on Switch or try and port it to my Anbernic SP. I want to play it properly one of these days...
- **LocoRoco**: I only played one level of this one and I think it's fun, a PSP exclusive to this day! Super cute and charming too, we'll see how it goes.
- **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe**: Played online and with friends a few times, there's a tournament going on at work too, so far so good, but my friends have managed to beat me more often which makes me feel old.
- **Mario Party 3**: Played a single match with some friends on NSO and that was a blast. CPU Wario beat us of course, evil stuff.
- **Tyrant's Realm Demo**: A souls-like roguelike that I tried for a bit, honestly quite nice, I have never played Dark Souls but now I'm considering it, not right now though.

## Device usage

### Laptop

I used my laptop for 61 hours. There's a lot of gameplay time that ActivityWatch didn't really pick up though, I wonder what's up with that, maybe Steam's Big Picture mode kills it or something, so, some of the time is obtained from Steam's Time Played instead.

## Final thoughts

But hey, they are all good games at least. Anyway, the month was crazy, work is crazy, Hunter x Hunter is crazy, it's all crazy.
