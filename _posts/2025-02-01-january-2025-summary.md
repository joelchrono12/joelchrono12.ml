Woah, a whole month just happened somehow. Here are a lot of the things I did during January of 2025!

## Gaming

- __Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age__: This is like a bedtime fairytale and I have enjoyed every time I pick it up for like 20 or 40 minutes and I can always stop at a comfortable place, knowing the game will come back and tell me the story so far is also a great bonus. Amazing story and very enjoyable turn based gameplay, it's just solid fun and amazing characters too.
- __I Was a Teenage Exocolonist__: Finally beat this little gem of a game, I shared [my review](/blog/i-was-a-teenage-exocolonist) recently so I won't say much more, play it if you like reading, making choices and card games.
- __Ridge Racer__: Doing gaming on my PSP again has been fantastic, I finally gave a chance to this arcade racing game and I can't believe I didn't do it sooner. Absolutely addicting gameplay, the thrill and the adrenaline of each race and just getting better at it feels great.
- __Minecraft__: I have been playing Minecraft for a bit late in the month, in a server I'm on with friends, we found the needed materials to finally beat go to the End and defeat the Ender Dragon!
- __Ys: The Oath of Felghana__: Another PSP game that has proven to be great. Hack and Slash action RPG with a hint of Metroidvania style gameplay too. Interesting story and simple mechanics, and an absolutely amazing sountrack too.
- __God of War: Chains of Olympus__: I literally played this like 3 hours in January of 2024 and never touched it again, and now I've returned to it a year later and I will probably beat the next 3 hours of gameplay left in February if everything goes well. Very fun though.
- __Balatro__: Balatro is Balatro and I'll keep playing it forever at this point.
- __Nintendo Switch Sports__: I got addicted to Golf for some reason.

## Manga

- __Hunter x Hunter__: is my new manga for this year, I've heard great things about this one and so far I am enjoying it a lot. I'm following the journey of Gon (finally, a name I can remember) to become a Hunter and find his father! Surprisingly charming and some nice action as well.
- __The Way of the House Husband__: Comedy manga about an ex-Yakuza who got married and does house chores and the like, it's fun!
- __Sakamoto Days__: I really like the direction of the current arc but I am waiting for more chapters to come out before I keep going.
- __Frieren__: Still amazing and very enjoyable, but it's on a break now so I'll have to wait some time before continuing the journey.
- __Komi Can't Communicate__: Catching up on this one as well
- __Gantz__: Well, I kinda forgot I was reading this but decided to give it another go, a bit too much at the moment but might return to it.
- __Elfen Lied__: Read just a bit of it again, still interesting but didn't grip me much.
- __Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou__: Only read one chapter this month, beautiful.
- __One Punch Man__: I am finally catching up to OPM, and it's been really intriguing all of what's going on lately, looking forward to more.

## Books

- I finished reading __Abaddon's Gate__ by James S.A. Corey as my first book of the year, it was absolutely fantastic! I wrote [my review](/blog/abaddons-gate) a few days ago so I won't say much more here.
- I also finished __The Murder on the Links__ by Agatha Christie a few days ago, I still don't write my review for it though. Still, it was a great piece of detective fiction and I really enjoyed my time with it, I actually read it alongside [@isa](https://thenighthas.me/@isa) and we chatted about our theories and suspects for a bit. Very nice mystery, I am liking Poirot's style more and more too!

## Movies

- __Sonic the Hedgehog 3__: First of the year, a Sonic movie! What can I say? Jim Carrey is abosolutely _in the zone_. And the last act has some absolutely bonkers action sequences, like what is going on? Honestly, good fun stuff.
- __The Moon__: Korea goes to the Moon, some action, some sci-fi, some korean patriotism, absolutely insane amounts of melodrama.
- __Interestellar__: Now this is some good stuff! This movie is still amazing, I so wanna watch it on the cinemas again now that is back for some time, but I might not be able to make it, still, it was nice to watch it again on a big TV screen.
- __Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning__: Well, I guess this is a movie that exists! Not the best of the MI movies, but enjoyable.
- __Inside Man__: Interesting heist film, there's a PSP on it, kinda neat stuff on it but I didn't quite click with it.

## Anime & Shows

- __Delicious in Dungeon__: I finished watching this show late in January, but I have been watching it on and off with my sister for a while already. It was quite nice, a different flavor of fantasy to what _Frieren_ does, very good, with great action and fun character interactions. It is like a Dungeons & Dragons turned into anime, and it delivers. The initial premise of making food out of monsters sounds like it might not be that hooking, but don't worry, there are lots of other things that kept me entertained throughout the whole thing.
- __Dr. Stone (Season 4)__: Ever since I binged all the previous seasons, I've been expecting this one, I already watched the first couple of episodes and wow, I had missed these characters so much, good stuff!
- __Hero Inside__: Ok so this is literally a kid's show, but it's somehow kinda neat? It feels like an old cartoon but today or so, in the good sense. In this show people can bring comic superheroes to life and control them using their imagination. But the action scenes are actually kinda sick, and the overall story is rather interesting.It's only a couple seasons with less than a dozen chapters of 18 minutes each, I'm kind of looking forward to the next season.

## Podcasts

- __Into The Aether__ ended the year fantastically with their [Game of the Year Spectacular](https://intothecast.transistor.fm/episodes/the-2024-game-of-the-year-spectacular), and every weekly episode keeps adding to the listening time, so it's only natural it remains at the top!
- __The Rest is History__ has been pretty interesting, I have been listening to their episodes of America in 1968 and the different events that defined that time, as well as how it compares to current times today, very interesting series.
- I've decided to not write as much about podcasts that I just listened to usually but can't really say anything specific about them, still I do recomment them! They would be: Darknet Diaries, NPC: Next Portable Console, Casefile, Retro Game Time Machine, and Trash Taste

Welp, there goes January. A lot of stuff happened huh. I am happy I didn't use YouTube as much this time around. And coming back to my PSP, reading a couple books, I am happy with how it went!
