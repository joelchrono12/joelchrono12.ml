Well, there were many things happening during 2023. A lot of new cycles starting to turn, the end of going to University and taking courses. My internship, writing 100 posts in a year, getting my first proper job, acquiring a Nintendo Switch, there were wins, there were losses, but I'm still here.

Compared to what I wrote [last time](/blog/looking-back-at-2022/) and in [2021](/blog/looking-back-at-2021/), a lot of things of more substance happened, so there were a little too many things to keep track of, which makes me glad I wrote most of what happened in this website.
