Hello everyone

This is just a simple attempt at doing a blog, it‚Äôs not really something
I understand completely, but I wanted to try it out anyways

Jekyll is not as hard as I thought

You can ignore this post since its just a test, and hey, if you are
seeing it, it worked!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back when I started this blog, which is not too long ago to be honest. I
had no intention on adding comments, And the guide on how to make a
static site I followed (made by Kev!), did not include that. In fact,
the code snippet shared in said guide for the post layout had the
following message:

  I don‚Äôt have comments on this site as they‚Äôre difficult to manage and
  take up too much time. I‚Äôd rather concentrate on producing content
  than managing comments.

  Instead of leaving a comment, feel free to contact me ‚úâÔ∏è instead.

And yeah, I was happy with that, but after sharing my blog in a Discord
server where I talk to some friends, they kept demanding comments, not
in a serious way, but just to troll me and annoy me (At least that‚Äôs
what I hope lol).

But after that, one of them sent me a link to a guide on how to do
comments using GitHub issues API (so yeah, you will need to have one if
you want to comment here, but at least it serves as a way to not have
absolutely everyone doing so, limiting a bit).

Customizing CSS classes üé®

And so, I decided to give it a try. I have to admit I just copy pasted
everything in it at first, but after doing so, I realized that it had
some conflicts with the Simple.css framework, which I used to make this
site look as it does. The profile pictures looked huge, and the
formatting was all wrong, so I did not like the look of it. I decided to
keep working on it. To fix the avatar pictures, I added this to my
custom.css file:

    .avatar{
        opacity: 0.9;
        width: 2.5rem;
        border-radius: 30%;
        padding: 2px 2px;
    }

Where the avatar class is included inside of the comments.html file that
I took from the guide, as well as other classes that I had to customize
myself so they don‚Äôt use the default properties provided by simple.css.
Said classes are here:

    .comment-url{
       line-height: 1px;
       font-size: 0.7rem;
       color: var(--border);
    }

    .comment-content{
      text-decoration: none;
      margin: 0 1rem ;
      padding: 0.15rem;
      font-size: 0.9rem;
      border-radius: 5px;
      line-height: var(--line-height);
      background: var(--code-bg);
    }

Getting comments to look good ‚ú®

Markdown can be used inside of comments too, so you can have headers,
lists, and everything markdown can (I think). This meant that I had to
limit and change letter sizes of them, so more CSS needed to be done. At
the beginning I had no idea of how to do it, but after reading the
simple.css file, I realized how some of the syntax worked. After some
attempts because I forget semi-colons exist and had to test different
values, it worked! So this is a snippet of how I limited the image file
size first.

    .comment-content img{
        margin-left: 2rem;
        border-radius: 5px;
        max-width: 40%;
    }

So I did the same thing for the headers, and quotes, and everything that
came to mind. In the end, comments were looking kinda nice, with a
decent looking layout.

Despite what my description said, I think there might still be something
you can break on this approach, but well, please don‚Äôt. If you want to
take a look at the source code of this blog, feel free to do so, since I
changed it quite a bit from the original.

So this was everything I did to add comments to my site. Once again,
huge thanks to Aristath, for sharing quite a great resource, and
Abhinav, who let me know of it.

This was day 7 of #100DaystoOffload, and I am quite happy with the final
results. Let me know what do you think in the comments! (I was eager to
write that, and I hope you can stop whining about this marrero171)

This was written right before I finished cleaning the floor of my house.
So I decided to write about it. It is going to be a shorter read that
usual.

I was already sitting in front of the keyboard and writing the first
paragraph of some random theme that came to mind, until I remembered
that I still had some stuff to do.

Every day I like to wake up pretty early, today the time was 5:40 am,
however, I don‚Äôt get out of bed. I know I could be getting work done, or
just doing something else that isn‚Äôt losing my time. But no, the bed is
too comfy and I just lay there doing nothing but scroll my phone screen
under the sheets of my bed, I blame it on the season, but its not a
valid excuse, since the place where I live is not really that cold.

At 7:12 am, I finally get out of bed, take a shower, get ready for my
day, turn on my computer, and do some work. After that, I have some free
time (or at least, time that is not being ruled by others who tell me
what to do), but then I remember, I have not cleaned the floor, nor the
dishes. I already had my text editor open, the metadata set up to start
writing. But I just can‚Äôt. I have responsibilities, and I don‚Äôt want
anyone but myself reminding me to do those chores.

And so I did, I swept the entire floor and then mopped it, washed the
dishes, and dried them. Now I am free, and I can have all the time I
need.

I find it really important to get stuff done and clear my mind, Right
now I don‚Äôt know what else to say. Some people manage to not do their
duty before their hobbies, and sometimes I do, when I really don‚Äôt feel
like actually working, and I know its no big deal. I am glad I have this
sense of responsibility though, even tho I wanted to do something else,
and there was nobody expecting me to fulfill those actions, I still had
me, and I am okay with that, because I am still here writing, I still
did what I wanted to do, and now I am done.

This is day 9 of #100DaystoOffload

I am writing this more for me than for you, this is by no means a full
tutorial and you should not look for answers here. I am just an average
Linux user who is still forced to live With windows on the same SSD as
the other. I am logging the way I fixed my issue because I got the
solution from telegram and it is kinda difficult to go there everytime
Windows is a bad neighbor.

By the way, I am using UEFI, so go somewhere else if you are using BIOS

Booting from a Live USB üõ†

This is the obvious next step if you have dealt with this kinds of
problems before, still I am typing it to make this at least a decent,
ordered read. I am using an image with Void Linux XCFE, the first thing
I did was go into the terminal and become root. I accomplished it by
using su and typing the password, which in Void is voidlinux

Mount your Linux partition

After doing that you have to mount your partition, firs run lsblk or
fdisk -l and look for the partition that contains Linux in it. In my
case, that partition is usually /dev/sdX5 where X is usually a or b
depending on my boot order and that kind of stuff. So, to mount it in
the /mnt folder, I do:

    mount /dev/sdX5 /mnt

Mount EFI Partition

After that, I need to mount the partition that contains the EFI System,
in this case, that partition is usually /dev/sdX2. It is important to
always check lsblk though, just in case something you had deleted some
partition or renamed something.

    mount /dev/sdX2 /mnt/boot/efi

Run this weird command

I have to do a couple of commands, first of all:

    for i in dev sys run proc; do mount -v --rbind /$i /mnt/$i; done

I am not exactly sure of what happens exactly, but if you try to do the
next steps, you will end up failing to install GRUB or rEFInd because
they cannot see the folder where the EFI System is (or something like
that, I am not sure). Now we are ready to chroot and do the final step.

Chrooting into your Linux system

Now you execute this command:

    chroot /mnt

Now your interface might not change at all, but by doing ls, or running
a command not available in the Live USB, like neofetch, you can know
that you are inside of your Linux, and access all of those folders and
programs.

Do a quick ls /boot/efi and check if the folders there match with your
system (there is usually a void-grub folder or something like that).

Fix GRUB

Now that you know everything is where it should, it is time to install
grub once again. Reminder: this guide is more for personal use than
anything, there might be some utilities like grub-prober or whatever
that I already had installed and you don‚Äôt, nonetheless if thats the
case, following this guide should fail without doing any major harm.
Run:

    grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB --recheck

Remember that all this time, you were chrooted in /mnt which is your
SSD‚Äôs root partition.

Using rEFInd instead üõë

I have followed these steps many times, and I always install grub,
however, after booting I end up doing refind-install to get rEFInd back,
I believe that I could just run it on the Live Environment, I just
always end up forgetting about it.

Reboot, and check whats is up üîÉ

This method has not failed me up until the couple of times I have had to
check telegram to remember these commands. I remind you that this might
not work for you but if nothing else did, ~~you can always give it a
try.~~

In my case, I am typing this from Linux, so I survived, and I hope you
do too. # Finishing thoughts üí≠

So yeah, Windows ends up being terrible with its updates, I really
needed to do this little guide once and for all. I hope it helped you or
at least entertained you or I have no idea of why you would be reading a
guide about something that still has not happened to you.

Anyways. this was my 10th blog for #100DaystoOffload, I it serves you
well, since it did for me.

Recently I have been thinking about why is it so hard to ask someone for
forgiveness when you do something wrong, that pissed someone off, but
it‚Äôs not a big deal.

Like, if you think about it, there is this weird middleground of actions
between drawing a stickman in the corner of a sheet of a friend‚Äôs essay,
to breaking somebody‚Äôs smartphone in anger.

Both of these actions are wrong, but the severity of the latter, can
really upset the victim of such thing, or make them seek revenge against
you, and if you did not really meant it, you feel bad, and look for ways
to pay for what you did. But on the first example, the action can be
ignored after a while, and the problem is fixed pretty quickly, and
usually everyone just forgets about it.

I just lived trough one of those moments. I did something wrong. The
other person got mad at what my action caused, then we kept driving on
silence for the next couple of minutes.

I got this weird feeling, the urge to ask for forgiveness, but at the
same time, I feel like my words would be answered by laughter, or just
be ignored since it was not a big deal at all.

Maybe it‚Äôs just the guilt building up within me. I start to think about
every little thing I have done in a similar manner, that seems to have
no importance on the grand scheme of things, and yet, I can remember
them now. I also can remember some (but not all) of those moments people
have done things wrong towards me recently, and I nor they said
anything.

So I decided to do it, I could not keep shut, I asked for forgiveness,
and guess what? Nobody even remembered what I did, and we all laughed at
the idea.

I am still glad of having done that, I was forgiven, maybe such little
things are not that important after all, but if you have that feeling,
maybe just getting it out there is the best way to deal with it and let
it go.

This was day 11 of #100DaystoOffload

title: Changing my android ROM once again header: Changing my android
ROM once again date: ‚Äú2021-02-16 11:49:00 -0600‚Äù tags: lifestyle android
foss degoogle description: ‚ÄúI have changed my rom again and degoogled my
device despite going back to school‚Äù permalink:
/blog/changing-android-rom/ redirect_from: /changing-android-rom/
layout: post comments_id: 5

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So as I stated before in the page about me I am a bit of an android
power user.

Last month I was using MSM Extended, with minimal Gapps and stuff like
that. However, today a new update for a different ROM happened. And I
could not contain myself, so I decided to give ArrowOS a try.

LineageOS is known for being the main custom ROM out there, but besides
privacy and such, I also want to have a nice level of customization, so
most of the time Lineage its not enough for my needs.

Now, the ROM is not really that important if you are still using Google
services, so I have decided to go almost googleless this time, and I
decided to share with you the main applications I am going to be using
this time.

I was quite happy to see that Simple Gallery and DuckDuckGo were
preinstalled, two great open source apps, Although I have a different
browser choice.

Migrate is the tool of choice to do backups of contacts, SMS messages
and app data. So I fired it up to get a few of my previously installed
apps back. Most of the times I backup absolutely every app I have
installed, but honestly, I wanted to go for something not only
googleless, but less distracting and more minimal.

Apps I wont install

In my previous ROM a lot of apps were installed that I really wanted to
get rid of and survive without them. These is a list with some of them.

-   Spotify
-   Youtube Vanced
-   Google Apps and Services
-   Solid Explorer

Apps I am keeping

These are a few apps that are not really open source, but I am keeping
for the sake of entertainment, or are actually necessary, or are simply
trustworthy for me:

-   Nova Launcher
-   Twisty Timer
-   WhatsApp

School is coming, Google is approaching‚Ä¶

In my country, we will be back to University classes in a few days (Yes
I have been on vacation up until now, kinda cool at first, but not
really anymore, this blog is one of the few things keeping me sane).
This means that I will have to use applications such as Google Classroom
and Meet, and their Calendar too, but I am going to try and keep all of
those Google programs away from my device, and in their own Firefox
container (what a great add-on to be honest) from my laptop, since sadly
they are unavoidable.

So yeah!, this has been day 12 of #100DaysToOffload, please let me know
if you are using any FOSS applications to stay away from Google and
such, thanks for reading!

So recently I have been thinking around the way I think and use
technology and software, the way I apply it to my life (not really tbh).
There are certain aspects of my mindset that I consider very important,
I have been applying some of them ever since I got my first piece of
technology, and others have become more and more important for my life
as time goes on.

All of these have some things in common, but sometimes the way current
technology has evolved makes them hard to combine. I don‚Äôt really have
an organized way to talk about this, but I will do my best.

Digital minimalism

This is one of those topics that got big on Youtube and other places
last year, and is still going strong. Applying a minimalist mindset to
the technology around me is supposed to help achieve a simpler digital
life, have less distractions and more time to focus on what actually
matters. Some of the ways to become a digital minimalist, are these
ones.

-   Get rid of unnecessary applications
-   Disable notifications
-   Enable downtime mode (black & white screen)
-   Limit social media and app usage
-   Use Cloud storage, organize folders, etc.

Privacy and Security

I have started to care about this more and more. Ever since beginnings
of last year that I installed Linux, as well as started to use
alternative social media such as Mastodon. I cared about new and
interesting topics that are starting to get a bit more recognized, but
also get some backlash.

Decentralization, Free and Open Source Software, avoiding Google and big
companies, avoiding mainstream social media, etc.

All of these factors have shaped the way I see society and the Internet
today, and it is quite a big reason to why I made this blog.

Customization

Ever since I got my first android phone, I started caring about this, I
learned about Icon packs, about android launchers, rooting, custom roms,
custom kernels.

The abilities to change almost everything I wanted about my phone, is
something I‚Äôve loved from android since I got one.

It is also a good reason I started to care about FOSS too, since I also
like to find alternatives to common apps, like Gmail, Facebook, the
default gallery and so on. Thanks to that I found out about 3rd party
clients (Frost, Twidere,) and alternative apps (Simple Gallery, Bromite)
that were more customizable, and better overall.

Side note: I actually just remembered that I started customizing Windows
XP quite a lot even before I got a phone, I also remember changing my
MSN Messenger themes or how my Hotmail account was organized, so yeah, I
have liked customization quite a lot.

Social media

I first started a Facebook account because I needed it on order to play
a mobile game, I did it in secret, since I was not allowed to have one
at the time (I hid the secret for 3 or so years, I felt so bad during
that time, that I actually didn‚Äôt use it and I stopped playing the game
after a week).

Thats how everything started, but years ago, after I confessed what I
did, there was this time I wanted to be using social media to get
attention and stuff (like every teenager), you know, uploading photos of
my origami figures, or videos doing magic tricks and stuff that I liked.
I was in groups of other people sharing their own videos and photos and
stuff like that. After a while I realized how terrible Facebook was for
my own good, since I spent so much time there and it wasn‚Äôt worth it.

However, after leaving Facebook behind, I started using Reddit,
Instagram, Twitter, and Youtube even more, until I adopted a more
minimal digital life (kinda?).

What was my point again?

I think this got a bit convoluted and I don‚Äôt really remember what I
wanted to say at this point. I have been thinking about this and I kinda
wanted to let it out.

I think I just wanted to spread the cards and see the way I am currently
working. I am still trying to get a better workflow. For example, I
still rely on services such as Google Docs or Google Drive (Digital
minimalism, decluttering, etc), at the same time, I don‚Äôt want to use
Google apps on my device in favor of F-Droid and FOSS (security and
privacy), however, I like to have my phone rooted and with a custom rom
(customization, freedom). All of this while I worry about how people
around me still don‚Äôt switch from WhatsApp, even tho I still don‚Äôt
delete Facebook nor Instagram, but maybe I should not and just use them
in a different manner?.

Sometimes I just want to not care about anything and do whatever I want
to do, as well as let other go on. But at the same time I don‚Äôt want to
look like a victim, or as if I am suffering because of taking this path.
I want more people to know about this, not to stay away from it. I dont
even know what I am saying now. This has been day 14 of
#100DaystoOffload, and I hope that I talk about some of these topics at
some point in a way that makes better sense.

So, today I was not going to have time to do my blog, and at the same
time, I have been thinking about doing stuff for the sake of getting it
out of the way and do nothing for the rest of the day. I am talking
about homework.

I will be going back to University this Monday, I am still going to be
in quarantine, but now I will have to study, assist to online classes,
do assignments and other things in order to continue my studies. And I
sometimes feel like I am doing this blogs just to deliver something even
if the quality does not compare with stuff that actually takes time to
and effort to complete.

Everytime I have to do essays for school, especially when they ask for a
certain amount of pages or words, I always try to expand the simplest
topics into full paragraphs, and over-explain some things. Thats exactly
what I am doing right now in an attempt to deliver a not so short blog
post.

Of course, I don‚Äôt want this to be a waste of your time either, so I am
going to share some quick apps I have checked this morning, and that I
am using to help me deal with distractions and use my time better, or
make my phone look epic or just because they are open source and I like
them.

DetoxDroid

So I have been looking for a way to be less distracted by my phone, to
be a bit more of a digital minimalist. Before I was using Google‚Äôs
Downtime mode, as well as other of their Digital Wellbeing functions.
Honestly I just wanted to have the ability to change to monochrome and
whitelist only a few apps like Newpipe or my Gallery. And so, DetoxDroid
managed to get it right, and it was also able to control Do not Disturb
mode with ease. It was all working as expected, until I tried to turn it
off, and the screen did not go back to normal. So, this app is still a
little bit buggy, and I stopped using it, but I will keep an eye on it.
At the moment, I found Monochromatic to work as expected, it just
requires an adb command to get it working (DetoxDroid can use root,
which I used to enable it).

DarQ

After putting my phone screen in black and white, I checked many of my
apps to see how they looked like, and one of those apps was the
Protonmail android client, which still does not have a dark theme. And
after many months since I‚Äôve known of this app, I decided to finally
give it a go, and checked Protonmail among a few others that don‚Äôt offer
dark mode either, and it all worked fine!, so yeah, DarQ is another fine
addition to this little app list.

Lemmur

So, I have been quite interested on Lemmy, a decentralized social media
similar to Reddit, and I wanted to give it a go. So I have used it for a
while, and one of its mobile clients made its way to F-Droid. Lemmur is
quite fantastic, still in its infancy, but already pretty complete, and
it does work great. It is just a pretty young mobile client for an also
young social media, so I don‚Äôt have nothing to say, but I hope that both
keep growing in the internet space.

QuickTiles

Back on android 4.X, one of the coolest things you could do was add
notifications that allowed you to launch many different programs from
your status bar. With the arrival of the quick settings on Android 7 (I
think?), devs were able to create their own tiles, and a bunch of apps
arrived that allowed you to do that. Launch apps from a quick setting,
or access shortcuts and so on. This is one of those apps, I found it
while looking for a way to do my screen monochrome, and while I did not
found that function, it still offered me some useful tiles, all open
source (and to think there are some paid options for this).

Share to Clipboard

So, this one is really interesting, for some reason, F-Droid‚Äôs has a
custom Share menu which does not offer a quick ‚ÄúCopy to Clipboard‚Äù
option, and other clients, such as Foxy Droid, don‚Äôt even have a Share
menu!, I did not try F-Droid Classic, nor Aurora Droid, but the point
is, that to make most of the hyper-links shown in this post, I used this
app, and then shared my clipboard using KDEConnect. So yeah, most apps
use the default Share menu, but I guess that I am going to use this
until F-Droid put their stuff together and add the option to their app.

It looks like I had more time than expected

But yeah, this weekend has been kinda busy and I hope I manage to do
everything I have to, and to be ready to go back to school. I shared a
lot more than I expected, and I hope you find a good use to these apps,
just like I did. This is day 15 of #100DaystoOffload.

Yeah I am still talking about the Android ecosystem, I have a few
thoughts about it that sparked this morning.

So, back when I started caring about Android, I remember how different
the ‚ÄúPower user‚Äù community was (at least the one I was exposed to on
Youtube videos). I remember watching those old videos of ‚ÄúBest android
browsers‚Äù, ‚ÄúBest music players‚Äù, ‚ÄúBest twitter clients‚Äù and so on, and
learning about apps such as the old Dolphin Browser, Rocket Player,
Fenix and others.

I also remember channels all around Youtube recommending apps such as
Aptoide to get pirated software or provide links to them (I am glad this
is not that big of a thing anymore, but I can‚Äôt say I did not benefit
from this a few times).

I have seen that the Android community has been pretty accepting of
non-FOSS applications. When it comes to customization, we still welcome
Icon packs, KWGT, the now dead Zooper Widgets and other apps.

Not only when it comes to customization. Root apps too!, I still
remember when Titanium Backup was the gold standard (even just months
ago, when it got banned, the community rised up to bring it back), same
thing with Lucky Patcher, and even Tasker, the most powerful automation
tool available for Android , all of these are NOT free software!

Even today, the Android community is still willing to accept apps such
as Bouncer, Naptime and others that are still being developed and could
be dangerous if it wasn‚Äôt because of the developer‚Äôs reputation.

Does FOSS have a place in the Google Play Store?

Recently I have seen more and more awareness towards FOSS, and I have
seen more people defending small independent devs and paying for their
work. But I have some controversial opinions about it.

I really don‚Äôt think that apps like Tasker, Typing Hero or Bouncer
should become open source. Not in an ecosystem that barely controls what
apps get added to the Play Store.

If you go right now to the store, and search for ‚ÄúGallery‚Äù, you will
find quite a lot of Simple Gallery based clones, that don‚Äôt even change
anything about the source code, besides the icons, and only bother
adding advertisement and other things that we can‚Äôt even see because
those clones don‚Äôt comply with the license by not showing their source
code.

Despite the license, there will always be people who will simply not
care. And will look to make money out of the work of others.

The worst thing about it, is that I remember seeing some posts on
r/androidapps asking to report those copycats, and you could still find
a couple of comments not caring at all about the situation, paraphrasing
‚ÄúIt is open source, what did you expect?‚Äù.

So, yeah, most of this adware is going to be allowed on the Play Store,
and if apps such as Tasker become open source, people with bad
intentions will be able to take advantage of it, and who knows what kind
of terrible things will happen.

This is not the fault of those apps, of course, this happens because the
Play Store is flawed by design. So yeah, unless that changes, I don‚Äôt
think that making such powerful apps FOSS will be a good thing, at least
right now.

This was day 16 of #100DaystoOffload.

In my country, Mexico, This pandemic is quite trendy, and its the only
thing they talk about on TV news. We can look at the stats and see the
big amount of people flooding local hospitals and passing away due to
the disease. I am not going to deny the impact of the virus here, I know
people who now are gone because of it.

But in reality, most people are living their lives without using
facemasks, unless they are working or going to the grocery store, its
simply no big deal and they go outside almost as if these times are
normal. I even got a haircut a couple of days ago, and besides the
people working there, everyone waiting for their turn was maskless,
thankfully, it was only a couple of people, so I took the risk.
Honestly, nobody really cared. And I was unable to wear a mask while my
hair was being cut, yes, it‚Äôs not ideal, but it is what it is here.

Honestly, I am okay with that, it is amusing how simple the lifestyle is
here. You don‚Äôt see crazy people feeling like slaves just because they
are ‚Äúforced‚Äù to wear a facemask inside of places that aren‚Äôt even their
property. And at the same time, I don‚Äôt see people complaining about
those not wearing a facemask when they should. Everybody lives their
lives and let others alone, and its up to you to take care of yourself.
Even old people keep working, some can‚Äôt really afford to do otherwise.

You can think whatever you want about the situation, I am just
describing what I see, I personally wear a facemask whenever I go
outside (if I am not getting a haircut), and I see it as a challenge to
see if my physical condition is decent (seriously if you have difficulty
to breath just because of a facemask, I think you should do more
exercise).

So right now I am finishing this blog while being on a Quincea√±era of a
family friend, which is quite a dangerous place to be in during these
difficult times. To be honest I am not a party person, but here I am,
surrounded by many different people, teenagers, adults, grandparents,
and they seem to be having a nice time, there are some regulations,
every table has a different family (or two families), but well, you
can‚Äôt control everybody.

I am finishing this already at home, we left early, I wonder what will
happen. My family already got sick a couple months ago, we didn‚Äôt
suffered too much, so we will probably be fine, and if that‚Äôs not the
case, it is what it is.

Or maybe everyone is actually taking extreme care of themselves and its
just me who only goes out like 10 hours per month and it just so happens
that when I am outside everyone becomes careless, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs
happening anymore

Day 17 of #100DaysToOffload

Well I got some free time, since I am typing this after finishing up all
of my homework, I am doing this blog in a quick and dirty way because I
just want to go to sleep after a day of learning not only about the
topics we will see during the semester, but also trying to find a new,
more minimal and simpler workflow when it comes to my homework.

I have decided to use Markdown and Pandoc to deliver both assignments I
had today, and I am quite impressed with the results. I watched a few
videos about how to do some stuff like formatting, using Beamer to do
slide shows and that kind of thing. I really think I might be able to
not need to use any Office Suite, if I manage to learn enough LATEX to
do my math equations and those problems.

One of my teachers is also quite a Linux user, he roasted Windows quite
hard in the first class we took, mentioning how their users need to look
up for software on websites and how superior the FOSS philosophy is, he
even mentioned how bad is Chrome compared to Firefox.

Anyways, it looks like this year could be not so terrible at all, it‚Äôs
only a matter of time to see how the rest of teachers are like in the
following week. I might talk more about my school workflow this weekend.

Day 18 of #100DaysToOffload

So, I have missed 3 days, but I wont let this blog alone. I have
mentioned a few times, and in a previous blg that I have gone back to
school, and I have managed to get some pretty nice teachers at the
moment. First of all, I wanted to share how I am doing my note-taking
and how I have delivered most of my homework. I will probably update
this very same blogif I find some more useful stuff.

My Markdown + Pandoc needs.

So, there are quite a lot of great tutorials mentioning different
commands, different tips, tricks and ways to use Markdown. However, none
of them are really mentioning every single one of my needs (which is
understandable). I am not talking about the simple syntax that markdown
provides, I will share a few of the ways I found to solve the following
needs, that were spread on different videos from different people.

-   Add citations, without the need of R Markdown or other programs such
    as Zotero, using APA formatting.
-   Display images on a desired size, without the need of previous
    editing.
-   Change the page‚Äôs margins as desired.
-   Change the language of the text.
-   Doing page breaks, or new pages.

Citations

The first one was the hardest to fix. Because most videos mentioned and
showed citations working on their examples, but only one of them showed
the commands, and none of them showed how to change the citation style.
So I am going to share it here in a quick manner.

First of all you will need to have a .bib file. This file deals with all
of your bibliography. I only have a single one, but you could have many
if you so wish (I don‚Äôt think that you can use many of them on a single
file tho). I use a Firefox extension to create this citations called
BibItNow!, I previously used it to get the APA citation, but now I only
get the Bibtex one. Each entry looks something like this:

    @BOOK{DUMMY:1,
    AUTHOR="John Doe",
    TITLE="The Book without Title",
    PUBLISHER="Dummy Publisher",
    YEAR="2100",
    }

After that you just add bibliography: /path/to/file.bib to the YAML
section of the markdown file.

To add a citations, you just do add @idofcite or you can also do
[@idofcite,p.number] and then, run this command, which will turn those
texts into corresponding citations, and add them to the end of your file
(You should add an empty # References to the end, so it will fill
automatically).

    pandoc file.md -o file.pdf --filter pandoc-siteproc

Finally, to add the desired formatting (APA in my case), I found a
website that contains the .csl files that you need so Pandoc can use its
templates. I just added csl: /path/to/file.csl to the YAML metadata

Image sizing

This is a quick one, I was tired of editing images so they looked nice
on my pages (they always kept their original resolution, which sometimes
looks terrible)

I just had to add this formatting to them, and that fixed it quickly:

    ![Image](/path/to/image.png){width=any}

Where any is the pixels I want the image to be. This does not work on my
website for some reason, but it does for the Pandoc output, which is
enough for me.

Page margins

I got this from Brodie‚Äôs video on his Pandoc markdown workflow, its as
simple as adding this to the YAML section of the file.

    geometry:
    - top=25mm
    - left=20mm
    - right=20mm
    - bottom=25mm

Of course, you can customize the size to fit your needs.

Change language, new pages, other LATEX goodies

I actually figured out how to change the language on my own. There is a
way to do it using a latex package called Babel (or something like
that), but I tried adding lang: es for Spanish, and it actually worked!

In order to make a new page, or add a page break, you only have to add
\newpage or \pagebreak in any section of your text file, and it should
be good to go.

You can also add a table of contents using \tableofcontents in the place
you want it to be in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the end, my complete YAML section looks something like this:

    title: Title
    author: Joel Chrono 12
    lang: es
    date: \today
    theme: Copenhagen
    geometry:
    - top=25mm
    - left=20mm
    - right=20mm
    - bottom=25mm
    bibliography: ../../uni.bib 
    csl: ../../apa.csl

The theme is only useful for doing Beamer presentations, but I will have
to make another blog to speak about that, since I found some things that
others don‚Äôt mention.

This has been day 20 of #100DaysToOffload

I have been quite distracted this past few days, I have had quite a lot
of free time, and yet, I have not really finished any important
homework, or made any progress on my game, and obviously, I have not
made another blog until today. And that was quite interesting to me.

During vacations, this kind of behavior was not really bad because I did
not have anything to actually do. Still, just because I don‚Äôt have
anything to do, I should stay doing nothing, therefore, if I know I have
stuff to do, I should be doing them first.

A few weeks ago I mentioned how I did what I felt that I needed to do,
even if nobody was forcing me to do so. But these past few days, I have
had some problems with that. I can make use of a lot of excuses,
honestly.

I can say that online classes are terrible, for example, most teachers
don‚Äôt even have a proper Google meet link, they create a different one
for each session, and they send it like 5 minutes before the meeting
starts. Some teachers are pretty care-free about the format of each
assignment they give us. Others want us to make use of PowerPoint or
templates that only work on MS Word, or some will even make us do
diagrams and maps and tables by hand. I don‚Äôt even have proper
notebooks, because I take notes on my laptop, but I have to make use of
one just for those few moments, and it is so annoying.

In 3 minutes I have another class, and I don‚Äôt even have the link to
join the meeting. I guess that I just don‚Äôt feel like doing my homework
(or anything productive at all) when I can feel the people around me
doing no real effort to be productive either.

However, now that I started talking about this, I think that I should
make an effort and stop this procrastination. Anyways, this has been day
22 of #100DaystoOffload, and don‚Äôt forget to drink water!.

By the way! Seriously, I have started to bring a water bottle to my
study area, by my side, and it is great, you drink a lot more, which is
good, you pay more attention when you are hydrated, and you don‚Äôt leave
as often, because water is already there and you don‚Äôt need anything
else!, ~~Unless you need to use the bathroom because of the amount of
water you drank~~).

Anyways, have a good day. I will try to be a bit more consistent again
~~hopefully~~.

As the title said, I have been playing with some bash scripting since I
was kinda bored. I was thinking about a blog made by Kev, where he
expressed how he moved away from Jekyll and back to WordPress. Now, I
have never used WP, so I don‚Äôt really know how many advantages, besides
the mentioned in his blog, it has.

But that blog helped me to see, and recognize some of problems and
annoyances I have with my current workflow.

Recently, I started to use Neovim to make my blogs, like the one you are
reading right now. And since I am already trying to be as minimal as
possible, I decided to make a script that helped me do the following
things

1.  Create a post file
2.  Name it and add its date
3.  Add the metadata to it
4.  Open it to start editing

Doing scripting stuff (Not a tutorial tbh)

So, doing a script on linux is kinda easy, because of the way UNIX like
systems work, I can make use of small utilities that can do small things
and wrap everything together to make new useful scripts to automate the
little things. In my case, I made something like this.

    #! /bin/bash
    echo "Type filename"
    read name
    filename=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d"-$name)
    touch /path/to/_posts/$filename.md
    printf '%b\n' "$(cat /path/to/_template.md)" >> /path/to/_posts/$filename.md
    alacritty -e nvim /path/to/_posts/$filename.md

A quick explanation

-   In this case, echo allows me to print text, just like printf, to
    keep the format of my template.md file, containing the metadata of
    the blog, sp I only have to fill it out (I could probably automate
    this too, honestly).

-   I used date to create the and format the filename of the post, as
    well as add the given title using read (I cannot use spaces, but I
    always use dashes - anyways).

-   I used touch to create the markdown file and place it in the right
    locations.

-   Finally, I open the file on Neovim in a new terminal window (my
    choice is alacritty).

Wrapping up

And that was it! I actually managed to do it. I am not sure if I could
make it even simpler, but I am happy with the result. I can now start my
blogs in a better way than before, where I copied and pasted everything
from a previous file, that I had to open and close and I also had to be
type the path of the file and make it and all of the usual stuff. But
hey, now it‚Äôs everything automated for me!

Also! I also made some changes to the font sizes of this blog, and other
CSS things, just because I felt that everything was a little too big,
and I didn‚Äôt feel like scrolling that much just to get past the title. I
think I still have to tweak it a little bit, but it is a good start.

This was day 23 of #100DaystoOffload, let me know if you found this
kinda useful for you too. Or if you have a better script or anything
that you use to make your blog workflow better!

The last few days, I realized my physical shape is not the greatest. My
life is not too healthy, I am not obese nor too skinny or anything, but
I know I could be better. I decided I wanted to do some biking and
exercise a bit, and since my bicycle was in need of reparations, I
needed to move.

A lot of walking (and a bit of biking!)

Yesterday I went downtown. The workshop is like 15 minutes walking from
my house. But I actually used my bike most of the way, since its only
problem is that I cant change the gears, so it works, but it feels
extremely light, which is good when going uphill, but you don‚Äôt get a
lot of power out of each pedal (is that the right verb? my Spanish
speaking mind is confused).

Anyways, once there, I only had to pay 105 pesos (around 6 USD) to get
the needed parts and their installation, I felt like it was extremely
cheap even for Mexican standards, I wonder how much it would cost in
other countries.

However, I had to walk back to my house, since I only had 100 pesos with
me (oof), the good thing is, I am actually pretty used to walking, and I
enjoy it quite a lot. So I came back home while listening some Daft Punk
(RIP), took the money and went back since the bike would be ready in 30
minutes (basically I arrived at the right time!).

So yeah, I went back home with a pretty epic fixed bicycle. It felt
quite nice, because it had been a while since I tried a functional bike,
and it was a lot of fun.

The next day‚Ä¶ (~~Today~~)

I had quite a lot of homework, but I really kinda wanted to go out and
bike for a little bit. However, distractions, procrastination, YouTube
and a bunch of excuses where clouding my mind. And I ended up doing
absolutely nothing worthy of being called ‚Äúwork‚Äù. I started doing some
homework, but I didn‚Äôt even finish it. I started getting my bike ready,
but I didn‚Äôt go out and used it. I even started the first Uni class of
the day, and the teacher didn‚Äôt even taught us anything!.

It wasn‚Äôt so bad after all

At the end of the day, at least I managed to do a couple of nice things.
I finished my other class Analysis and Design of Mechanisms, which was
actually extremely nice and I would say I learned a lot. And I did most
of one of the homework I had to deliver this week! (I still have some
more tho, sadly).

However, I know I can do better, tomorrow I will try and do some proper
biking, as well as finishing most (if not all) of my homework. I feel so
bad about what I didn‚Äôt do today, because I know homework is easy, but I
struggle to get started. And biking is great, yet I made excuses not to
go out.

Well, this felt like some kind of journal, but its my blog, I do
whatever. This was day 24 of #100DaystoOffload

So, at this point you should not be surprised at a blog that talks about
making and optimizing the way this blog is done. I already made some
posts talking about the way I made creating blogs easier for me, so now
I will talk a bit more, but this time about the blog layout itself.

I have made some changes to the CSS, as well as modifying some pages,
such as the tags and blogs one. Up until the creation of this post, the
blog archive has been a relatively small list of all of the blogs I‚Äôve
made. However, thinking about the future, I wanted to split all of this
into sections, divided by year and month. To do that, a asked for
suggestions on Mastodon. And of course, I got some replies. I ended up
on Stack Overflow and found some ways to do what I wanted.

After a check there, I added the following lines to my blog.md file
(located on my site‚Äôs root directory). {% raw %}

    {% assign postsByYear = site.posts | group_by_exp:"post", "post.date | date: '%Y'" %}
    {% for year in postsByYear %}
      <h1>{{ year.name }}</h1>
    {% assign postsByMonth = year.items | group_by_exp:"post", "post.date | date: '%B'" %}
    {% for month in postsByMonth %}
    <details><summary>{{ month.name }}</summary>
    <ul>
      {% for post in month.items %}
       <li>
       <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a><br>
         {% for tag in post.tags %}
        <a class="posttag" href="/tags/{{ tag }}">{{ tag }}</a>  
         {% endfor %}
            üìÖ {{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }} <br>{{ post.description }}
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        </details>
    {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}

{% endraw %}

I made use of the nice <details> HTML element which is quite pretty
thanks to Simple.css, the CSS framework I am using right now. I also
used them to the tags page, which has a similar structure to the blog,
although is quite simpler.

{% raw %}

    {% for tag in site.tags %}
      <details>
      <summary>{{ tag[0] }}</summary>  
        {% for post in tag[1] limit:3 %}
          <p><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> - üìÖ {{post.date | date_to_string}} </p>
        {% endfor %}
      <a href="/tags/{{ tag[0] }}/" class="button">All posts</a> <a class="button" href="/feeds/{{ tag[0] }}.xml/">RSS</a>
      </details>
    {% endfor %}

{% endraw %}

Of course all of this might be quite weird and I am not going to pretend
that I understand it all! I added tags a while ago and it took me some
time to get the grasp of it. Remember that as a Jekyll SSG user it is my
duty to let you all know of every little piece of liquid, HTML or ruby
code I add to it!.

This was day 27 of #100DaysToOffload. Dont you love it when most of your
blog consists of copy pasting already existing text and avoiding to
explain most of it assuming your audience will understand it? I hope you
did because I am done with this. I hope you read next one (and I hope
its not as lazy)

If you want you can check more about this here: * How to display raw
Jekyll code in a Jekyll site * How to split posts by year and date

I am pretty sure that most people reading this are aware of the changes
LastPass did to their free-tier customers. A lot of articles already
talked about that, and some might be in the process of switching to a
different service, to host their own or to use an offline solution.

I have been an huge fan of Bitwarden, which Wikipedia page states:

  Bitwarden is a free and open-source password management service that
  stores sensitive information such as website credentials in an
  encrypted vault. The Bitwarden platform offers a variety of client
  applications including a web interface, desktop applications, browser
  extensions, mobile apps, and a CLI. Bitwarden offers a cloud-hosted
  service as well as the ability to deploy the solution on-premises.

Not only it offers a pretty great free option, it completely decimates
most of the competition besides LP when it comes to security, privacy
and transparency.

I can only think of a couple of options when that can be better. Pass, a
pretty minimal option that follows the UNIX philosophy (and might be a
bit too extreme), and KeepassXC. I chose the latter, and to be honest, I
am quite happy with the results. Bitwarden allowed me to export my
database as a .csv file, and importing it to my .kdbx (not to be
confused with xkcd) database.

But honestly, I am not here to tell you which password manager to use,
if you are switching to a new one, or if you just have some time. you
should do some house keeping.

üîë Get rid of weak passwords

One of the features Bitwarden locks behind a paywall, is the ability to
look for duplicated passwords. I was aware of the existence of multiple
accounts sharing the same passwords. Back when I switched to Bitwarden,
I was using my browser‚Äôs built-in autofill feature (don‚Äôt do that
please), but I still used the same password everywhere. And I had been
living with that for years.

You are probably doing that too for some of your accounts, I suggest you
to do yourself a favor and change those passwords as soon as you can.
Luckily, KeepassXC can show me duplicated passwords, and if you are
self-hosting or paying for Bitwarden, you can have that functionality
too.

There is something important to keep in mind. If you come from LastPass
(or any other proprietary manager), you should consider changing all of
your passwords. You really have no idea of what they are doing behind
the curtains. For all you know, they might release all of your
information to the Web the moment you stopped using their service (or
even if you still are).

üíÄ Get rid of your old accounts

Funnily enough, the moment I started going through all of those accounts
with repeated passwords, I realized I had a bunch of accounts that were
deactivated, breached or were from a dead website/forum.

I have been deleting accounts I don‚Äôt need, changing the passwords of
those I have to keep, and requesting the deletion of some that don‚Äôt
offer any way to delete them myself. So far, my recycle bin contains 64
accounts and counting, which will get automatically deleted after a
certain time (quite handy if I require to get some back).

‚ú® Enjoy a cleaner, private and epic setup

Maybe you have heard of Inbox Zero, the digital minimalism practice
where you get rid of all of your old emails that you won‚Äôt really read.
Well I have never really done that. But I assure you that it does not
feel as great as having a completely tidy and well organized database of
passwords and accounts.

This was not a matter of clicking a ‚ÄúDelete All‚Äù button or using some
magic script, but the product of 4+ hours (in my case, your mileage may
vary) of going through bloated menus, sending/replying emails, logging
to multiple accounts, checking if they still exist, taking the time to
debloat my database and have only the accounts I need in there.

Wrapping up

I am quite happy with how everything turned out. I really can‚Äôt
encourage you enough to try and do this, even if you are already using
KeepassXC or any other manager. This has been day 28 of
#100DaystoOffload, I guess I should give this a hashtag huh?

Are you ready for a #PasswordDebloat ?

It has been a very long time since I have properly read a book. I have
always been an avid fan of reading as a hobby and as a good habit that‚Äôs
worth practicing, it‚Äôs even on my about page listened among the hobbies
I have.

Nevertheless, it had been a while since I‚Äôve been so invested reading a
new story. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still reread some pages of old
favorites. But in all honesty, I just felt like I did not have the time
to read something from start to finish.

However, the Easter vacation period started, and we traveled to visit
some family. Obviously, due to COVID, we would not be able to go out
anywhere, and most of the time was spent watching movies or YouTube
videos with my cousin.

üöÄ Discovering a new Universe

Because of this new free time, I decided to read something, I am not
sure why, but I remembered a series recommended to me by a friend:
Bobiverse.

So I decided to give it a try. I had not read anything about it, I did
not look for any reviews, all I knew was that my friend‚Äôs nickname was
Bobiverse too, so he had to like it quite a lot (Just like how I love
Chrono Trigger, best SNES game indeed, @ me I don‚Äôt care).

The series is about a nerdy developer who gets his head frozen and
turned into an AI 100+ years into the future. It feels quite grounded in
reality and I really recommend it a lot. However, this is not a review,
I might do one in the future, once I read the whole thing and let it
process and bit more.

According to my Screen Time, during my first week of vacation, I spent
30+ hours reading, completing 3 of the 4 books of the Bobiverse series,
totaling around 700 pages. And this week I will keep reading the 4th
book, which has around 400 pages.

I am not saying all of this to brag or anything, I know people who read
more as well as people who don‚Äôt care. The point is, I had never read so
much in such a short amount of time.

üñäÔ∏è My favorite genre

I already knew what was my favorite genre, but I really never stopped to
contemplate about how the huge ratio between it and the rest of the
bunch. Is it Fantasy?, bibliographies?, essays? ~~Self-help?~~, Wrong!,
the answer is‚Ä¶

Science Fiction

What a surprise huh? Bobiverse is sci-fi, but I had never realized, that
basically everything else I‚Äôve read is, too. I used to think ‚ÄúI like
sci-fi, but I have read a lot of other genres and kinds of books!‚Äù. But
while trying to remember all those ‚Äúother‚Äù books, I ended up with The
Mangy Parrot, The Pilgrim‚Äôs Progress and Narnia.

Of course, I have read a few pages of books from school, biographies and
such, but I can‚Äôt really name any right now. Yet I still remember Star
Wars books, Halo books, 20000 Leagues Under the Sea, Ready Player One,
The Time Machine‚Ä¶ you know the drill.

There is something about sci-fi, reading and imagining things that could
become true, realizing some of them became true. Admiring the
descriptions of imaginary concepts and locations, and loosely used
scientific terms, from the center of the Earth, to Virtual reality
worlds. From submarines and telegraphs to Slip-Space traveling and Von
Neumann probes. Infinite places, infinite concepts, infinite
possibilities.

Some, if not all of them usually have characters that I really like and
that I can relate to, or understand. Be it the nerdy programmer Robert
Johansson, the epic engineer Cyrus Smith, or the complex and intriguing
Captain Nemo.

The genre also allows the expansion of existing universes of movies and
video games. Reading the origins of the first contact between Humanity
and The Covenant, or the (sadly non-canon) secret Apprentice of Darth
Vader. You learn lore and stories at a level that no other medium is
able to convey.

It‚Äôs so much fun.

The best thing for me, is that it looks like I haven‚Äôt even started. If
I look for lists of ‚ÄúThe Best Sci-Fi Books‚Äù, Only some of the ones I
have mentioned show up. I guess my taste is more ‚Äúclassic‚Äù, Jules Verne
and H.G. Wells are only a small fraction of the genre. I still haven‚Äôt
touched Dune, or anything done by Asimov or Huxley. So I still have a
lot of material to read, I just hope that my previous experiences don‚Äôt
ruin the new ones to come.

‚åõ Finding time for Reading

Regardless of the genre, I think that reading is something that can be
enjoyed by everyone. Some people say that they don‚Äôt like it, some say
they can‚Äôt fit it into their agendas, just excuses.

I have talked about how great audiobooks and especially podcasts can be
before, since they allow you to do other things while still enjoying a
good talk or story.

Nonetheless, there is something about being able to focus on written,
simple text, give your own voices to different characters, building
whole worlds (and universes) in your mind and just let the time fly by.

Admit it, if you are reading this blog, you have time. Get an agenda,
wake up early, stop being lazy!. I am writing this to myself but you
probably relate to this too.

If you don‚Äôt know how to start, any of the mentioned books here are good
choices, you can always search how many pages or words a book has, but
recently I‚Äôve realized that the important thing is not the length, but
the enjoyment you get out of it. I haven‚Äôt really read anything longer
than 500 pages or so. But if I the amount of time I spent reading 3
books in a week tells me something, is that as long and you get invested
in the story, the number of pages doesn‚Äôt matter.

üóû Wrapping up

I think this is the first blog I have done where I spent more than a day
writing. Expressing my thoughts on this subject was quite challenging
but also very fun. I found myself very surprised at the amount of
reading I did, and I was so compelled by the accomplishment that I
decided to write all of this.

I hope you try and find some time to read something soon too, and if you
still think you don‚Äôt have it, at least exercise your mind in other
ways.

This has been day 29 of #100DaystoOffload. I hope you enjoyed the blog,
have a nice day.

Drink a lot of water, stay safe out there, read.

Lately, as you can see, I have been adding many little details to this
website, in order to make it my own even more.

Everything started with Simple.css as a base, you can go to that website
to see how it looks by default. The first changes I did were pretty
simple. Since I love the Nord color scheme, I just implemented those
colors, then I modified some other values, and some more, then added
classes, and id‚Äôs, and I ended up with the current design!.

Adding new details to my site

I did all of this to keep myself entertained and to challenge myself
trying to understand CSS and HTML better, so I could eventually figure
out problems by myself (and with the Internet‚Äôs guidance) and design the
stuff I liked.

I also have played around with the way Jekyll works, I have added tags
and some HTML snippets, making use of the _include folder to avoid
cluttering my layouts and that kind of things.

So for a few days I started checking out some blogs and websites to
borrow inspiration from, and I ended up with a new footer section, as
well as a new showcase area in my front page. And don‚Äôt forget the new
SVG icons and dividers that look awesome.

Due to the rush in inspiration, I decided to go ahead and change
something I have been meaning to do for a while.

Revamping the comments section

While GitHub comments worked nicely, I wasn‚Äôt really getting a lot of
activity lately. I think that happened because I didn‚Äôt set them up. You
see, for every new post, I had to create a new issue, and honestly, I
didn‚Äôt feel like it. So I just stopped having comments. Besides, most of
the people who keep track of this blog are aware of Mastodon. Therefore,
the path to follow was clear.

Instead of trying to actually learn some JavaScript. I decided to search
for some already existing solution. so it didn‚Äôt took a lot of time to
find Carl Schwan‚Äôs blog, who already blessed me with a script that did
exactly what I needed. I just had to do some changes so it works with
Jekyll‚Äôs syntax, so I basically changed the {% raw %}{{ .stuff }}{%
endraw %} with {% raw %}{{ page.stuff }}{% endraw%}.

I also had to add those new variables to my blog metadata, which was not
hard to do, since I just modified my already existing rofi script to
setup my blog‚Äôs metadata with a few new lines. I still have to setup the
id, like on GitHub, but its easier since I already create the Fosstodon
post anyways.

Conclusion

In the end, I am very happy with the results, I am quite surprised with
how my blogging journey has been. Sometimes I don‚Äôt have time to do
blogs, and sometimes I have too much time and do everything but blogs.
But hey, today I decided to do a blog and implement some new features,
yay!

This has been day 30 of #100DaystoOffload, thanks for reading! And don‚Äôt
forget to try out the new comment system, I didn‚Äôt really worked too
hard for it, but I still had to setup some CSS to make it look good!

So, this morning I was watching a video by HexDSL, where he rambles
about many things (as usual). However, he mentioned something that got
my attention. He is now streaming music to his phone[1], using MPD.

I decided to try and do the same. Streaming my own music has been
something I‚Äôve wanted for a while. I looked around for ways to achieve
it and I found a blog by Joran Schrijver[2] where he shares the solution
I chose to follow, and that I am going to share here, as well as some
troubleshooting I had to go to get this working. You don‚Äôt even need to
have MPD installed on your desktop!

Install an android client

Now, we first need to install MPD itself, you can find it here. We also
need a client to play our music from. There are many options, MPDroid is
one of them, it has not been updated in a while, but its interface is
still decent if you want it. MAFA is the solution suggested by Joran,
but it is paid, and I am not sure if it‚Äôs FOSS, but if you don‚Äôt mind,
go for it. HexDSL however, suggested M.A.L.P and it‚Äôs actually a really
good FOSS option too, which is a little more recent, since its last
update was 4 months ago.

Satellite setup on your desktop

So, before we configure MPD on your client device, we have to setup a
server. The way Joram did is with a quick Python command.

    python -m http.server --directory ~/music 8000

I assume you can setup any other way you like.

Configuring your Android device

Up until now, you could say I am just stealing Joram‚Äôs blog, but here is
where things change just a little bit. By following it, I got a bit
stuck, so I went to the Arch Wiki[3] for help with this problem.

Setting up MPD on Android

First things first, create a text file and name it mdp.conf and put it
in Android‚Äôs home directory (/storage/emulated/0/mdp.conf).

After that, you have to add the following lines to it. I got this
additions from the wiki

    # located at /storage/emulated/0/mpd.conf
    music_directory "http://desktop_ip_address:8000/"

    database {
      plugin "proxy"
      host "desktop_ip_address"
    }

    audio_output {
      type "sles"
      name "Any name you want"
    }

In order to know your PC‚Äôs IP address, just run ip address on your
terminal and look for it, It should be something like 192.168.0.x

Now just run the MPD app, there might be some exceptions or things that
look like errors on the log, but as far as I can tell, it should be
nothing serious. Make sure to look for a line mentioning the loading of
the config file, you might have not placed it correctly, or have some
mistake.

Setting up your MPD Client

Now, you have to set up the Music player. Depending on your app, there
might be some different paths to take. These are the settings that show
up by default (and it works), so I just want to share them to make sure
we are on the same page. ### MPDroid

Go to Settings -> Connection Settings -> Default Connection Settings. -
Make sure your host is 127.0.0.1 (I assume it could be any localhost
address). - Your port should be 6600 - Password is up to you and your
own settings. - Streaming host is blank for me, I assume it can be kept
that way. - Streaming port is 8000

You can play around with the settings. Also, there is a dark theme and
you must enable it.

M.A.L.P

You can go to Profiles, and set up the same things. However, there might
be one already setup for you.

In both cases you will be able to see the output with the same name as
the one you gave to it in mpd.conf

In case something doesn‚Äôt work

-   Check your internet connection.
-   ping the IP address and see if it is there.
-   Try to enter from your browser and see if its there.
-   Delete and add your network (Seriously, I was unable to find my host
    address, I even ran nmap with Termux on Android and it still didn‚Äôt
    show up until I added the network again).
-   Force close MPD and check your config.

Now play some music!, and finish this up

If you did everything correctly, your music app of choice should begin
to load your music library, and you should be able to play it with no
problems.

Once again, I am not here to guarantee that this will work. You can
check the footnotes for more help if you still did not manage to get
your MPD streaming working.

The caveat of this, is that you have to keep your machine running that
pyhton command. But you could figure out a way to make this better, the
Arch wiki has some suggestions that you might want to take a look at.

This has been day 31 of #100DaystoOffload

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I have had some trouble coming up with new themes to bring up and
talk about. The last days have been quite normal, and I have had some
ideas to share and explore. But, for some weird reason, I end up coming
up with excuses to not talk about them or I have some weird fear of
people not caring about what I have to say.

However, I have decided to not listen to those thoughts of mine. And
talk about whatever I want. This is my blog after all, so I should not
be that invested in what others think of me. I don‚Äôt really talk about
controversial topics anyways, but I think I got to the point where I
convinced myself that I only wanted to talk about things that caught the
attention of the broader audience.

Not anymore, I talk about whatever I want. There were some excuses and
ideas floating around in my mind. But there I was, thinking excuses such
as:

-   Too many people already talked about that.
-   I would need to investigate a lot in order to cover the theme
    properly.
-   I can‚Äôt expand this theme to have a decent length.
-   It‚Äôs Saturday, nobody will read it.
-   I already started writing about something else.
-   I will get in trouble if I think the wrong thing.

Guess what?. Nobody actually cares, the people who care will read what I
said, and that‚Äôs what matters, ~~kinda~~.

Anyways, I have many ideas right now, and although I won‚Äôt expand them
all on this post, but I can do a brief description of what‚Äôs to come.
Maybe not everything will end up coming to existence, but hey, I do the
blogs I want.

-   Some talking about Chrono Trigger, my favorite game of all time.
-   Talking about how much I enjoy videogame soundtracks.
-   How I developed my first game for a week long game jam.
-   How I have been going running and cycling more often.
-   I kinda switched to Emacs and I have a crisis between it and Vim.
-   Talk about Rubik‚Äôs cubes or magic as hobbies.
-   Promote some of my favorite YouTube channels that ain‚Äôt related to
    Linux.
-   Continue to talk about my text adventure game.
-   Some other ideas to come.

So yeah. Not a lot of content in this post per se, but hey, I am working
on it üòâ.

This has been day 32 of #100DaystoOffload, I hope you enjoyed the quick
read. I want to be done with this challenge sooner than later, and I am
glad I noticed this insecurity of mine, hopefully it doesn‚Äôt come back
anytime soon. Until the next post.

Lately I have decided to change a bunch of stuff when it comes to my
workflow with my devices. Be it my laptop or my android phone. I have
made some changes mostly out of boredom, but also because I have got a
few problems that I didn‚Äôt feel like fixing on Spectrwm, as well as
other quality of life changes.

ü™ü Leaving Spectrwm, embracing Awesome, considering DWM

I really, really liked Spectrwm, I might as well go back to it in a few
days, since the main reason I am moving away from it might not be that
hard to fix. I find the system tray to be quite useful to me, my choice
was trayer, since it was good enough. However, I had some problems that
made it feel pretty clunky.

-   I can only show tag numbers,or numbers + name. I want to display
    only the names, which are Nerd Font glyphs.
-   The systray will overlap with the bar content, at least on the
    position I want it to be.
-   The systray wont follow me when switching workspace, but I have a
    script that moves it using wmctrl
-   When trayer gets moved to my current workspace, it steals focus, if
    I close every window, it steals focus
-   If trayer gets mouse focus, I cannot do anything, no keybindings
    will work. The only thing that works is clicking an icon that opens
    a window (like Discord) or killing Spectrwm from a TTY

Honestly, most of these problems are not a big deal most of the time.
But as I said, I am doing this mainly out of boredom, so let me be.

Installing dwm also came to mind, and I decided to give it a try, but
right now I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it, but I might check it out
later.

üåê Changing Firefox, checking out Qutebrowser

For quite some time, I have heard good things about Qutebrowser. So I
have decided to give it a try. I actually loved it, I really liked the
way it works and I found myself extremely comfortable using Vim
keybindings on it. I really enjoyed how smooth it was and the keyboard
driven workflow.

Its engine is now based on Chromium, which is a bit annoying since I
support Firefox‚Äôs Gecko. However it now will display most websites
better than when it was using WebKit as a base.

So right now I decided to go back to Firefox, and set it up in a similar
manner to HexDSL‚Äôs configuration, which has tabs on the left side and
gets rid of most of the GUI, making it pretty nice looking to me. I will
change to Qutebrowser once I set it up properly and get ad-blocking on
it.

For now, Firefox + VimVixen will do to give me that Vim-like workflow. I
actually can‚Äôt believe how handy and nice it is.

üíª Maybe distro hopping, changing rom again

After all this, I have also been thinking about changing my distro once
again. I have enjoyed void for quite a while, and its great, with no
doubt, I might just be a bit inspired while writing this and I might end
up not switching after all.

I have been considering something like EndeavourOS, or maybe
reinstalling Void, but base only, we will see. I am a bit tempted by the
‚Äúterminal driven‚Äù workflow the claim to have, I already have that on
Void, but I am still curious.

Also, I will change my Android rom soon. I haven‚Äôt updated it in a
while, and I have been looking for a bit more customization than what I
already have. I have downloaded CrDroid, which has an official rom
available for my Redmi Note 8, so I will give it a try later today.

Syncthing and Migrate are great tools for making backups, and I think I
will have to install minimal Gapps due to school stuff, and because I
got some paid apps I can‚Äôt live without, such as Nova Launcher or Typing
Hero. I am working towards changing that, but not right now.

I always feel quite dirty when I have to change rom and reinstall the
Google apps, especially when I try to defend FOSS and Android in
general, but well, you gotta do what you gotta do.

Wrapping up

Anyways, after all of this I gotta say I am quite happy with the changes
I‚Äôve done, and I hope the ones I still have to make will be good too. I
have had some problems with time management, and I know that it‚Äôs kind
of a meme the amount of time you invest on setting everything up on
Linux to get actual work done. But well, I enjoy it, and I still managed
to deliver all of my homework! So I consider this a win. I have exams
next week, so let‚Äôs see what happens with that.

This has been day 34 of #100DaystoOffload

After a month or so of using Keepass to manage my passwords, I wanted to
set up something even simpler, and I decided to give it a try once and
for all.

Pass is an extremely simple tool to manage your passwords by using GPG
encryption on plain text files, allowing fairly customizable folder
structure.

It follows the Unix philosophy of doing one thing and doing it right. It
can be extended with different clients and plugins that expand its
functionality and allow features like auto-typing, otp support and
filename encryption, which is kinda nice.

Pass functionality

I am going to assume you know how to make and deal with gpg keys. But I
will leave some sources if you wanna deal with that.

So, all I did was run

    pass init <gpg-id> 

Where you use the id of a preexisting gpg key you have. After that, to
save a password you use

    > pass insert personal/example.com/account-name
    Enter password for account-name: account-password

If you‚Äôre creating a new account, you can use:
pass generate <account-name> which will make a random password and save
it automatically.

Pass uses the first line of a file as password, and you can add extra
lines to it if you so wish. Therefore you can use the -m flag to
continue adding lines when creating a new entry.

I set up my files like this:

    password
    url: example.com
    login: account@example.com
    otpauth: otp_url_thing
    autotype: login :tab pass :enter :delay :otp :enter
    comment: whatever

I already explained enough of Pass itself, but this is not an in-depth
tutorial, so if you wanna know more about pass itself you can visit its
website

My personal setup

Coming from Keepass, I used pass-import and the following command

    pass import keepass keepass_file.kdbx

This means I dont need to risk a plain text file such as CSV, which is
kinda cool.

But, how do I actually use it?, well, on Linux I use rofi-pass, a great
utility that makes use of rofi and has support for a lot of features,
including auto-typing and otp support if you have the extension pass-otp
installed. These tools read the lines I showcased before, which is
pretty practical. I am quite a fan of how simple it is to configure and
extend pass, and the amount of existing tools that make use of it is
great.

There are some browser extensions. I tried PassFF , but in the end I
decided to only depend on rofi, since its simpler and safer than a
plugin in my opinion.

Pass on Android

On my android device I decided to install Password Store which is a
great client that supports auto-fill and other things.

However, how do I sync everything up?. The answer is pretty simple.
Syncthing, a program that need no presentation.

I just shared my password-store folder to android and called it a day.

Password store needs OpenKeychain to gain access to your gpg keys. To
export your private key you have to run this command from your terminal:

    # In my case is gpg2, your distro might just use gpg
    gpg2 --output secret_key.gpg --armor --export-secret-key <gpg-id>

Just copy it to your device and import it from the OpenKeychain app. it
should prompt you to input your passphrase and now you can use it on
Password Store.

The app works surprisingly well on browsers, compared to other password
managers for Android, although its not as good on some apps, of course
your mileage may vary, most of them should work just fine.

Pass on Windows

I again used Syncthing to keep everything up to date. I installed
gpg4win to get everything gpg needs to work and I imported my key using
Kleopatra, which gets installed automatically. You could also use the
command line but I didn‚Äôt know it was available when I did it.

I was unable to find a working solution similar to rofi-pass, I am a fan
of Wox launcher, but it didn‚Äôt have a plugin for pass, and it hasn‚Äôt
been updated in a while so I decided to go for browser-pass which is a
browser plugin. I would have preferred a native program to do it but it
is what it is.

There is actually a native program, QtPass. But it doesn‚Äôt have some
pop-up shortcut and I didn‚Äôt feel like finding out how to do keyboard
shortcuts on Windows.

Browserpass is wonderful though, and it is still being updated, so I
will still use it, and I will use QtPass for native applications.

Some Troubleshooting

During my experimentation, I faced many problems. Sometimes saving new
passwords or edited changes on existing entries would not work. This
happened because the .gpg-id file used by pass was trying to encrypt the
files with a non existent key, since, Password Storeoverwrote it (I
assume that it is a subkey that only existed on android and the rest of
my devices are not aware of it).

Another problem is getting the password-store folder location to be
found by both of these programs. The plugin settings provide a way to
set a custom folder, and so does QtPass, I placed my folder in
C:\Users\my-user\password-store and managed to use it quite easily.

Final thoughts

I am really liking this setup, pass supports using git to manage
branches and that kinda stuff. But I decided to keep it simple and just
use Syncthing as mentioned before, I dont really have a secure git
instance or somthing like that, and since the filenames are not
encrypted this can be a bit of leaked metadata, but that isnt really a
problem locally, and its probably no big deal if I make a private repo
on Codeberg or something like that.

I kinda wanted to make this blog a bit longer, but its honestly not that
difficult to do the switch and I just provided a few sources across this
post that could can be helpful if you need something more.

This is day 37 of #100DaystoOffload

I had a crazy last week, I barely had time to do my homework and I
didn‚Äôt even have WiFi for a couple days, I also lacked time to sit down
in my computer and work on my blog.

During those days, while working and thinking, a lot of ideas crossed my
mind, and I am a little sad, because I already forgot most of them, some
of which could have been nice blogs, but I was unable to write them
down, at least on paper or a quick note.

Yesterday, and today, I spent some of my free time to do some cleanup of
my Hotmail account‚Äôs Inbox. There were hundreds, if not thousands of
emails coming from old accounts, old forums, Facebook notifications,
YouTube uploads, Blogger newsletters, email chains and spam, and a lot
of other trash that was there stored in some random Microsoft server.
And among those emails, there were a few conversations I had back in the
day, some old friends threads of chatting and sharing stuff we missed
out on, it brought some nostalgia for older times.

Also, reading some article or post shared on Mastodon, I ended up
reading a PDF, dating from the 1800‚Äôs (or maybe it was a website?) and I
realized how important and amazing writing stuff down is. Somebody
somewhere, took the time to record these thoughts, store them and share
them to the world.

I have no idea of what will happen to those old conversations I had on
email in 2013, what about the chats and threads I have in Forums, Matrix
servers or Fosstodon? Don‚Äôt even get me started on MSN Messenger and the
stuff I used back then, before advocating for FOSS.

I recently started to use PGP encryption for my emails, and to think
that I am probably the only person who has the key to read the contents
of them, is amusing.

I write these posts in plain markdown text, which is then converted to
HTML thanks to Jekyll, but, how will it be in the future? Yeah, plain
text files might still be readable in 50 years, but, just like that PDF
file, or those old books, will someone be reprinting these words in new
formats? new languages? will somebody even read this a week from now?

I have some tracking enabled on this site, using GoatCounter, but I only
visit it like once a month, and I don‚Äôt really get more than 20 or so
visits. I don‚Äôt really mind, in the end, I am writing it for me.

I doubt that a way to recover those lost thoughts will ever exist, all I
can do is write what I currently think, and maybe hope for a trigger
word to bring back those memories, preferably in front of a keyboard.

This is day 39 or #100DaystoOffload

This is going to be a quick blog where I just wanted to mention how I
added this new section to my website, I already spent quite some time
editing it, so I guess I can make this blog shorter than the rest.

Inspired by PsychoLama and by Ru Singh, who have a ‚ÄúRecommendations‚Äù and
a ‚ÄúUses‚Äù section respectively on their sites. I wanted to do the same,
and decided to get started on it as quick as possible.

Right now its still fairly incomplete, but I can update it when deemed
necessary, not only for new software I discover, but for the programs I
stop using.

This idea came out of the blue, I did not have a school class and
decided to go for it. It might as well be the most unplanned post yet.

I want to add some new sections in the future, a blogroll, a reading
list, a Now section, so many things to do. I will make a post whenever
that happens.

Besides, the last couple months have been quite short on content, and I
wanted to add some extra entries to keep up with the #100DaysToOffload
challenge. Although at this rate I feel confident I will complete it in
less than a year!.

This has been day 40, almost halfway there!

Monster Hunter is one of my favorite franchises, even though, I haven‚Äôt
actually played all of the games, I enjoy the content and I love the
community around it.

You‚Äôll see, I am not in a position where I can acquire a lot of games
and spend money on consoles or even a decent computer, so, when a friend
gifted a PSP to me on my birthday back in 2012. I was really, really
happy. It was my second console, since I already had a Gameboy Advance
SP where I only had a couple decent games, and a pretty low chance of
getting more.

One PSP game that affected me quite a lot was Monster Hunter Freedom
Unite. I played it for hundreds of hours, and I really enjoyed it.
However, my joystick stopped working properly, and I was unable to play
it on my PSP. That unfortunate event, opened the way to a world of older
games and emulators that didn‚Äôt required an analog stick, a topic that I
will explore in later blogs.

Back to today‚Äôs topic, I discovered that I could not only play Monster
Hunter again, thanks to PPSSPP, but also enjoy hunting online for the
first time, thanks to a platform known as Evolve HQ. This tool allowed
the creation of parties and chatrooms where I could interact with other
hunters and help each other out. All I had to do was start my copy of
the game using the PPSSPP emulator and configure the networking settings
to the one provided by Evolve, visible in the GUI. Back then I was
playing on Windows using a cheap Xbox-styled controller.

However, by the end of 2018, Evolve HQ closed its servers (archive), and
I stopped playing for a while. Before that, I was already looking for
different ways to play, and I found out about the HunsterVerse, a P2P
(player 2 player) network that is used to play different PSP games
online, mainly the Monster Hunter franchise. So after Evolve HQ died, I
moved there for a few weeks until, for school reasons, I had to leave
the game again, with a few hunts sparsed here and there.

Until now.

During the whole pandemic, it never once crossed my head the idea to
spent some time playing there. I wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way though,
since I learned a lot about other things such as Linux and Game
development, which one could argue are better ways to spend the time
instead of infinitely grinding trying to get the part I need to complete
my armor set.

Anyways, I had been cleaning up my emails the last couple days, and
while doing that I found the email I received when signing up for the
HunsterVerse, it contained my OpenVPN profile, which is the tool used by
the HunsterVerse network. And I told myself ‚ÄúWhy not give it a try?‚Äù, I
installed OpenVPN from F-Droid, imported the file and copy pasted my
game and savedata to my android device, and voila!, back at it again!

Just kidding, after 2017, the profile certificate had to be fixed with
some new changes, and I had downloaded the previous one, so I checked my
email again and found a more recent email that contained the new
configuration, since I had asked for it back in 2019 for some quick
hunts I did that year.

I downloaded the file, forwarded the emails to a more email address and
got to play! I just re-installed OpenVPN (The F-Droid version didn‚Äôt
work for some reason, so Play Store had to be open) and joined a quick
match with my small account, unaware of the new enemy I had to face.

I was barely able to move, I was so used to playing using my controller,
that using touch controls on my phone was painful. I am aware that some
players deal with that and have set their own layouts and custom
buttons.

Despite that, I decided to join a room and set up a quick low ranked
mission. I didn‚Äôt even had to ask, and a group of hunters joined and
after getting ready, we parted to hunt a Velocidrome, one of the easiest
monsters in the game.

The camera controls have always been known for needing a ‚Äúclaw‚Äù grip
that would kill your hand over time. I was pretty used to it, but the
lack of a tactile feel made it even harder, along with accidental
touches, and a lack of vision due to my fingers being all over the
screen, made it so my teammates had already killed the monster in 4
minutes, and I didn‚Äôt even manage to find the corpse to carve some
goodies.

Anyways, it was a fun first hunt after a couple years without playing,
and since Summer vacations are coming up soon, I am planning to get
myself a controller to properly play this game and enjoy it like the
good old times.

If you didn‚Äôt know about the HunsterVerse, I really recommend joining
its Discord server, even if you don‚Äôt play those old games online, they
also have chatrooms for the newer games, such as Monster Hunter Rise
that came out this year.

This has been day 41 of #100DaystoOffload

So I have been quite inactive here. The end of the semester is
approaching and I really received a lot of new assignments in quite a
short amount of time. But today I finally got a bit of time to breath
and take a break. There are still some small works to do as well as a
final project, but I no longer feel the same pressure as last week.

I am actually quite happy of how much icons I managed to do during the
days before my previous blog, since the following days after that were
quite tiresome. I wonder if spending that time playing around on
Inkscape affected the amount of work I got after, but there was no hurry
at the time, and while there was work and projects I could have done
instead, in the end there would have been no difference.

One of the assignments I got was from a teacher who is a bit of a Linux
evangelist. He asked us to install a Linux distro and showcase how it
works, as well as how to install a program on it. It was just an
optional thing that would only score a few more points to the final
grades, but since I was already using Linux, I couldn‚Äôt help but going
the extra mile

Switching to EndeavourOS

Obviously, I already knew how to do all of the requirements, and the
teacher said we could do it on a Virtual Machine if we wanted. However I
decided to take the opportunity and switch my distro once again.

I was also having a few caveats with Void, there were some random
graphical glitches, almost as if the display connector was not working
anymore, sometimes the screen became just glitchy lines and I had to
close my current window or switch workspace in my window manager (so it
was not a hardware issue, and it has not happened since I switched).

Another ‚Äúproblem‚Äù was that I just could not figure out how to make cups
work with my printer and stuff. In the end I realized that I was just
dumb and managed to make it work, but I was already on EndeavourOS, and
as I plus I managed to use the AUR to get scanning working too!

I ended up choosing EndeavourOS mostly because I wanted to experience
Arch without the hassle of installing it. In the end I was quite happy,
because Endeavor is almost as light as Void, it only had around 800
packages installed, which is quite less than I thought compared with the
ISO‚Äôs weight.

The installation had no problems, but the online installer took a lot of
time to finish up since my internet connection is not that great.

Overall I am pretty happy with how it turned out and despite a few
hiccups getting Jekyll running again, I managed to make it all work and
it has been wonderful.

Delivering final projects

So, somehow, I managed to go overkill on all of my projects despite my
severe lack of confidence on the knowledge I have acquired during this
semester. I really struggled with most of the subjects and professors. I
felt like most of them were lackluster in the content given each class,
or maybe its just me not paying enough attention in class.

I am not really that sure of whats the best way to learn for me. I
thought I would like to have online classes this time, that my teachers
would learn how to manage Google Classroom, how to setup their meetings
on Google Calendar, or something like that. Instead, we had to wait for
their message sharing a photo taken from their phone showing the Google
Meet link.

Anyways, the point is, I had to deliver two pretty big projects, one of
them consists on simulating the production process of something, in my
case,chose Yogurt. The second one was about the text adventure game I
had to do for my Discrete Math class.

I felt quite dissapointed by having to do the first project as a
simulation only. I learned about LabVIEW, a proprietary software that
uses a graphical programming language known as G We learned a bit about
DAQ cards, PLC‚Äôs and other protocols related to human-machine
interfaces. But in the end, I only used basic algebra, booleans, event
structures and for loops to ‚Äúsimulate‚Äù the whole process, and I didn‚Äôt
know if I should be proud or sad, because it looks like my block diagram
was the most complex one in the class.

I felt like I should have learned more, that I should have actually
connected some PLC to my computer or setup a server somewhere. I have
learned more about computers and communication protocols just by
switching to Linux and setting up a blog!

Now, the second project was a bit more exciting for me. I had to make a
text adventure game for my Discrete Math class. I wanted to go with full
force and use Godot Engine as my working environment. I followed a
tutorial series to understand the basics, but since at this moment it‚Äôs
still incomplete, I had to keep going by myself, I am used to that so
that was no big deal.

Most of my companions had games based on predefined choices and a small
story to tell. That is alright, but I wanted to make stuff like command
processing and an actual room layout where you can move, pick stuff up
and unlock pathways.

I managed to get it all working just in time, and you can get the source
code and binaries here. The game is in Spanish and its also quite short.
But let me know what do you think of it, if you manage to complete it. I
wanted to have some kinda story but I just managed to do simple
descriptions and hints.

The only thing I am a bit upset about is everyone has their python and
C++ binaries which are around 200kb and my files are around 40mb, but
well, that‚Äôs how Godot works, and I have a full graphical interface
there too.

Finishing up

After all, I managed to get this two big projects. I will talk more
later about the second one, since I am quite happy and I have a lot to
tell about it.

This was quite a long post, and I didn‚Äôt expect to write this much, so I
am gonna call it here. I still have a lot of work to do for other final
projects, but they have to be delivered next week, so I still have some
time. Endeavor is awesome, my projects were great and I am cant wait to
finish this semester.

This has been day 45 of #100DaystoOffload

Up until now I have been using Neovim to write my blog posts, and it has
been working wonderfully, as far as I could tell. However, something got
my attention recently.

I have been playing around with blop, a static site generator written in
bash that uses pandoc, sed and other simple utilities to generate a
blog. I have decided to give it a chance in a new site I got because I
joined a tilde pubnix.

What even is a pubnix or a tilde you might ask? Well, its kinda like a
shared computer where you can log into using SSH. There are a lot of
communities like that and you can checkout some of them by visiting the
Tildeverse website

I decided to join to tilde.cafe. I got accepted a few days after I made
my request, and it has been a great experience so far.

Coming back to the mistake I mentioned before, neovim offers some neat
syntax highlighting by default, and I enjoy to have it not only for
Markdown but most other programming and markup languages that I use
every now and then.

But Markdown was not working somehow, and I did not know why, it was
kinda working, but headers were showing up as if they were comments,
with a gray coloring since I use the Nord color scheme, which made them
harder to read.

But I just thought I had some weird plugin and I never really tried to
fix it, since the rest of things worked as intended for the most part.

It was not until I used blop to with my current posts that I noticed
that most of them were not working. There is some simple templating, and
only the header and footer showed up without any of the content. I spent
a lot of time messing around with the metadata on top of it, which is
kinda different from Jekyll. Like this:

    ---
    author: Me
    title: Title
    summary: A summary
    date: YY-MM-DD HH:MM
    ---

But there is something that is not noticeable at all, an extra space at
the end of the last dash, which came from my good old rofi script, that
has a line like this:

    echo -e "# Previous metadata ...  \n--- ">> $path/$filename.md

And as you can see, that little space in the end was messing it all up.
The sed command used in the bash script was not finding the last "---"
and it just went through the whole blog. After removing all of those
spaces, everything started to work as intended, and now I have a new
website, which is a mirror of this one, using my tilde.cafe domain, and
you can visit it here

This is day 46 of #100DaysToOffload

Home alone, but not my home

Last week, a some family friends had to go out of the city for medical
reasons, they have a little chicken farm and a couple of pretty active
dogs, and they asked me to take care of them all for a couple days.

Both of the dogs are really great trained so it was pretty easy to take
care of them, they let me know when they need to go outside and ‚Äúfulfill
their needs‚Äù, they eat in order and they even know their schedule when I
had to give them treats or take them for a while. All I had to do was be
there and pay attention when they stared at me for a while xD.

One of the dogs is a little puppy, and she liked to bite stuff, but she
had a couple of chewing toys, and it never represented a big problem.
Even when sleeping, all I had to do was leave the bathroom door open,
and they would go there if they needed to.

Now, our friends got some chickens too, they actually sell eggs, and
they are pretty great, since they feed them with a good mix of corn and
other natural seeds. I picked up more than a dozen eggs during the days
I was there. It was quite an interesting experience.

I also had to cook for myself. Having parents who cook is quite epic, it
is one of the things I enjoy about my culture, families still gather
around almost daily to eat together, at least once a day in my case. But
of course, this time I was alone, although there were some goodies
waiting for me there, like some homemade chocolate cookies and stuff.

In the end it was quite a nice experience, I actually got a nice amount
of time to be by myself and think, which is always a good thing, I did
not even felt the need to write a post or anything until today, a couple
days later.

The last day when the house owners arrived we all ate some burguers
together.

A Black Widow mini-Review, finally going to a movie theater

While I was still taking care of our friends house, I got a message from
the family group, asking me when will I be done. Turns out that they
wanted to go to the movies, for the first time since the pandemic
started. We ended up unable to do so that day, but we were all free
tomorrow, so we all got ready to got right after lunch (and doing the
dishes).

The only movie we decided to watch was Black Widow. It was quite an
interesting movie, while not a masterpiece, I still had a great time
watching it and we even got some popcorn, which is quite a privilege for
us in our economical situation. If you don‚Äôt wanna be spoiled, just stop
reading already, because that‚Äôs the rest of this post.

I kinda really liked Yelena‚Äôs personality, almost like a female
spiderman who happens to be used to kill people. She is basically being
set up as the next Black Widow, and I am OK with that.

I kinda not liked that the OG Natasha Romanoff got carried into all of
this in a not so natural way. Also she got into a lot of situations that
should not be survivable by a normal human being, of course she also
fought with aliens, so its fair enough.

Honestly, most of the protagonist companions were pretty good, compared
to other movies where they have no depth at all. The Red Guardian got
pretty mistreated tho, I wish we could have seen a more serious side of
him without being ridiculed.

I am sorry, but nowadays most people are saying to men to share their
feelings and to not hide their emotions, that it is OK to cry and stuff
like that. Yet, the Red Guardian gets the role of a caring but dumb
father who is treated like a clown every time he opens up their feelings
towards his family. Actually, most men in the movie are ridiculed one
way or another. Except for the one who gets Romanoff a place to hide.

Lets not talk about Taskmaster, seriously, I am not qualified for that
since I was unaware of his story on the comics, or in this case, her.

The final villain is quite interesting, but of course they had to
protect him with some incredibly dumb pheromone shield because he is
just a regular guy who happened to create an army of Black Widows under
his control. And of course that such protection can be broken, by
actually breaking your nose.

The last grand action scene is quite epic, not gonna lie, although a
huge incredibly impossible mess, but that‚Äôs how it is in the Marvel
universe, and I am here for it!

When it comes to political stuff, I am a bit annoyed by movies that
follow a feminist agenda just for the sake of it, but I would say this
movie is not one of those, and its approach is better than stuff like
Captain Marvel or Charlie‚Äôs Angles, which is a good thing.

Although the overall package is kinda clumsy. Yeah I will give it a
6/10, would not watch again unless I am on a Marvel movie marathon,
since I think watching it in chronological order would feel better.

It was a good bit of family time outside of our home. Also, its worth
mentioning that, most of my ‚Äúcomplaints‚Äù did not come up while watching
the movie, I really don‚Äôt mind to just enjoy the action and the popcorn
most of the time, and I did so successfully in this case, which means
the movie is pretty goot to me. Also, the tickets here cost the
equivalent of 3 US dollars, so that‚Äôs epic, I‚Äôve heard that going to the
movies in the US is quite expensive.

Anyways, this has been day 49 of #100DaysToOffload

The previous couple weeks I have been finally on vacation. This time we
are not planning to leave the city and go outside that much. Yeah, we
went to the movies and I talked about it on my previous post, but that
is something that we would have done even if we weren‚Äôt on vacation.

For some reason I have been offline from some communities I used to
visit more frequently, when it comes to game development or web design.
If I do it, I only say hi, exchange a couple messages and then leave and
go do something else.

I also started to wake up a little later. I am not really that lazy, I
wake up at 7 am or 8 at most, but thats quite a difference from how I
used to wake up at 5:30 am a few months ago. I think that I just wanted
to completely rest and start over with my routines. Almost like how I
used to factory reset my phone every now and then. I hope next semester
I manage to stay on a good schedule, avoid procrastination and I keep
giving proper attention to my classes, instead of losing time on the
web.

All of this was kinda normal, I have been through similar phases before,
however, something else happened.

I lost two dogs in a matter of days, the first one was a puppy we
adopted, but we found out she had a contagious disease and was starting
to suffer convultions and vomit, and we had to put her to rest. Her name
was Navi, like the fairy from Ocarina of Time, only a couple months old.
She was pretty playful and it never really looked that sick most of the
time, I did not really managed to train her or built a strong attachment
to her, but its still sad to think she is not here now.

The second dog is Chicharito (Little Pea in English, which sounds kinda
fun). He is a little Chihuahua, around 9 years old, and he got scared
during a storm while he was in our front yard, where we usually let him
go from time to time, altough he stays inside for most of the time. This
happened a day later after Navi died, which made it even worse for us.

I was busy getting ready for going out with some friends, and I forgot
he was not in, and when I realized, I took an umbrella and went out to
look for him. The whole family started looking for him, and we actually
got stuck outside because nobody took the keys. I had to get myself
dirty climbing to the roof and then jumping to a patio behind our house,
where the backdoor was still open.

Back to the search for the dog. Some kids were looking for him too, they
told me that my dog was inside their house looking for shelter, but
runned away after a while. We looked for him a couple hours with no
luck.

We placed some posters in the streets and the colony‚Äôs Whatsapp group. I
walked at least an couple hours every day looking for him, many times a
day. One night I had difficulty to sleep, I got really sentimental
thinking about how scared he was and how lost he must be. I am not
really the expressive even in times like this, I find it kinda
ridiculous to be losing my mind when I could be looking for him. But
well, this happened during the night, so it gets a pass.

In the morning of the next day I received a phone call, a neighbour saw
him in front of his house, me and my dad went running there, three
blocks from our place. Sadly, we were unable to locate him, and I
started to lose hope.

Thankfully, after just two days. That same neighbour called again. I was
already in my bed about to sleep, and my sisters asked me if I knew
where our parents where. I woke up from bed and waited for them, since I
had a good feeling about this. Minutes later, they returned, and, as I
thought, they bringed Chicharito back!, it looks like he was inside the
neighbourg‚Äôs house hidden under a chair. I got really happy, and slept
pretty nicely that night.

I think this is not the most exciting story ever, but well, its part of
life. This is day 50 of #100DaysToOffload

Social media and me

So, social media has been quite useful for humanity, however, it has
also become a big problem among people of all ages and demographics.
Personally, I have been affected by it differently as I grow up and
develop my thoughts and lifestyle.

The first contact I had with social media, was MSN Live Messenger, I
used to talk to people I knew, play online games and of course, ping
them constantly until I had an answer from them!

But I was just a little kid, and I only talked to family or friends from
school. I was still inside this little bubble where I had no real idea
of how big the internet could be. I also had a Club Penguin, but despite
being in a multiplayer environment, the social aspect of it flew over my
head at the time.

It was not until middle school, that I got an android device, I got
Whatsapp, and got engaged into looking for apps and customization. At
one point, I created a Facebook account. I was not allowed to have one,
and I felt incredibly guilty the moment I did it, so I actually did not
use it for years.

However, after I got permission to use it, I ended up pretty addicted to
it, I joined different groups and follow random pages that were popular
or that I heard from classmates at school. Some of them were fine,
others were a little bit to edgy, and I was constantly distracted by
memes and mostly useless posts. As I grew up, I started to delete old
groups and follow more meaningful topics for me. And of course, due to
all of this, I was feeding Facebook with personal data and ad revenue.

At some point I realized how problematic this was for my life. I managed
to stay with good grades and keep up with real life shenanigans. But I
still felt attracted to my phone and to Facebook.

I would like to say I stopped using Facebook because I started to use my
phone and social media less. But no, looking back, the reason I did, was
because I started to learn English, and I joined Reddit. I had heard of
it for a long time, and it was actually pretty amazing. I started to see
how most of the memes I saw in Facebook where born there, I got
interested by the sense of anonymity and separation. How nobody cares
about you, but the content being shared in the subreddits.

I joined a few communities related to my interests, Doctor Who, Origami,
but I also joined a bunch of places full of toxicity and gossip. Yeah it
was nice to see how news and memes came out here first, seeing how
Youtubers got ideas for their videos and stuff like that. But at the
same time, I started to be surrounded by politics, debates, conspiracies
and a lot of weird things that I was not really interested in seeing,
and yet, there I was. I am probably going to clean up my subreddit list
one of these days, or just start from scratch with a new account. It is
kinda amazing how powerful reddit‚Äôs Karma can be, I have a decent
amount, and only because of that I have doubts about getting rid of my
account, even though it has no real value.

At some point I also had a Twitter account, but I successfully deleted
it. I have to say I only had it to participate in Giveaways of app codes
and such, and I actually won a couple times, but well.

Anyways, after I grew aware of how most of social media disrespects my
privacy, I ended up looking for alternatives, and I found Mastodon,
which a social media app similar to Twitter, which can be self-hosted,
so all of your data stays with you. Or you can join instances hosted by
people you are willing to trust. The point is, there is no single
centralized server where everything you do is tracked. At first, I
decided to join a bunch of instances, since I did not know how
federation actually worked back then. I have found some nice people, and
I have been inspired to do things to improve my life, like making this
website! Thanks to it, I have a way to share my thoughts without having
unwanted eyes all over my data. Of course, anyone could scrap this and
make some profile to identify me, but well, I am saying this willingly,
without having to abide to any terms of service. Even if Netlify or
GitHub, where this is site is hosted, have anything against me, I can at
least keep all of my information locally and host it somewhere else.

Detox Day Log

Anyways, the original reasoning I made this post was to share what I was
going to do during this day. Besides writing this blog, I have spent
quite some time contributing some icons to the Arcticons Icon pack,
while listening to podcasts on YouTube and AntennaPod.

Being honest, I opened Mastodon for about 4 minutes until I remembered
which day it was, and I also opened Reddit for 8 minutes because I
forgot again. But other than that, I have avoided social media, enabled
Do not disturb, deleted some apps. I even decided to leave Nova
Launcher, which has been my choice for years, and tried out Olauncher
once again! I hid all of my those distracting app icons and ended up
with a pretty sick looking setup, if I do say so myself.

After some though, I‚Äôve also requested my data from Reddit. There is no
way to export my data from the usual settings menu, but it can requested
via this link. I‚Äôve decided to finally delete my account. Having a
history and social media points is not that important, and some peace of
mind should be quite good.

After listening to the latest episode of Darknet Diaries, which is about
the problems someone got because of having a good Instagram username.
The fact that an account can be that valuable is mind-blowing!
Thankfully none of the usernames I‚Äôve used are worthy enough for someone
to harass me because of them.

Finishing thoughts

So, I started writing all of this yesterday, during Detox Day, and this
final words are done a day after. I hope this movement takes off, in my
case, I did not found a lot of movement in my country and language,
although that might be because Facebook and other common social media I
don‚Äôt use are more common here. Anyways, I found myself having a decent
time, but I have to admit I spend quite a lot of it on YouTube, but it
was not that bad, since I mostly use it as background sound and, as
previously stated, to listen to a few podcasts and long videos that are
only available there.

I deleted my Reddit account, funnily enough, the exported data only
occupies a couple megabytes, since it does not include the images and
videos, just csv files and hyperlinks. I think I will keep most of the
posts and comments there since they don‚Äôt contain any compromising
information. This is mostly about getting rid of social media and less
about gaining privacy, although it is a nice plus. I‚Äôve also exported my
Instagram data, and I might delete it sometime soon.

The journey has been difficult, but I am happy with my progress. This
has been day 51 of #100DaysToOffload

During my digital journey I have liked a bunch of things, one of those
are Podcasts! I have shared some of my favorites before in a small
review I did on AntennaPod, a free and open source podcasts app.

In my previous blog, I talked about what I did during social media detox
day, and I mentioned how most of the things I did were done while also
listening to Podcasts. In a matter of months I discovered some new shows
with a bunch of episodes to listen to. And I decided to share some of
those here!

Suspense, Crime and mistery

So yeah, most of the stuff I listen too is quite focused on these
topics, but I only listen to these at nights right before going to
sleep. I think I might have some problems in my head‚Ä¶

Unexplained

I started listening to this just a few weeks after my previous post. It
is simply amazing, as the name implies, the podcast shares stories and
events that don‚Äôt seem to have a logical explanation, from haunted
houses to UFO‚Äôs, the voice and narration by Richard MacLean Smith is
simply incredibly. The only thing I dislike about it is the ads located
in the middle of the show that manage to break the atmosphere quite
heavily. Maybe if he kept the creepy background music and tone, as well
as a nice segway it would be a lot more acceptable. Nonetheless, I‚Äôve
listened to 63 hours of this show, and it must be for a good reason!

Already Gone

This true crime podcast is amazing, a solo, female host with a super
smooth voice describing events in a great manner and a good structure,
While the voice got me hooked, the quality of each episode kept me
going. I had listened to a lot of Crime Junkie and I started to get
tired of the same structure of making questions and short ‚Äúhuh‚Äôs?‚Äù and
that deal, is good to have simple narrations without filler. The
episodes are also quite shorter, around 40 minutes, but you‚Äôll have to
skip a couple ads in the middle of each episode.

Website RSS Link

The Video Palace

At first, I though I would not like this show, but the short and concise
episodes, along with the great voice acting made me stay. This is a
single story about a young couple who decides to investigate a mistery
after watching a VHS tape with an unknown origin, it is really short,
with only 10 or so episodes, and the story is worth it, I hope there
another season gets made.

Website RSS Link

The Phenomenon

This one is amazing, this audio drama tells the story of how almost all
of humanity extinguished just by looking up, and how the try to find a
way to stay alive. The mistery is strong on this one, each episode
follows the events of different survivors that interconnect in a bigger
story. I don‚Äôt wanna spoil it, so all I can say is this. Do not look
outside, do not look at the sky, do not make noise.

Website RSS Link

The Magnus Archives

I just started listening to this, it shares multiple fiction stories of
horror and suspense. The ads don‚Äôt interrupt at all, since they are
located at the beginning or end of each episode, it seems to have some
interconnection but each story can be enjoyed separately. Sometimes the
audio is a bit bad but that only adds to the experience of low quality
recordings being archived, as the title implies. Another great thing
about this podcast is that it is licensed under a Creative Commons
license, which is actually really cool!

Gaming, tech and Linux

If you are not a fan of being unable to sleep (Although I actually
listen to all of the above while in bed), you might enjoy these other
lighter, more tech focused podcasts. I listen to these across the day,
while cleaning my room or doing the dishes and stuff like that.

Retro Game Time Machine

As the name implies, this is a small podcast where two friends travel
back in time and talk about their experiences playing an old videogame,
from Super Mario Kart to Halo: Combat Evolved. This show is quite
enjoyable, the audio quality is great and it also starts with current
news to stay up to date with the gaming world. I wish it went deeper
into the significance and importance of the games being played, since a
few times it feels a bit rushed. Overall it is pretty good!

Website RSS Link

Waveform

This is the podcast hosted by Marques Brownlee, tech talk at its best
with some nice sections, the audio quality is spectacular, it is not too
focused on software, but it is still a nice addition to have. The
episodes are less than an hour most of the time too, and its easy to
listen to at 2x speed. Not my favorite, but is quite enjoyable and has a
great video format if you care about that.

No Website RSS Link

Command Line Heroes

This podcast became an instant favorite, different stories narrating the
creation of programming language, the evolution of open source and
technologies used all around us today, the host has a great personality
and there is many interviews with experts of their field. This means
that some sections have lower quality audio, which might be a bit
annoying, but I have learned a lot from this podcast. Its also short and
sweet, around 30 minutes per episode, and quite easy to listen at 2x.

Website RSS Link

Into the Aether

This is another gaming variety podcast, it is somewhat similar to RGTM,
but quite more general and also with better quality audio. It has no
significant structure and its quite rambly, but that‚Äôs what I like about
this podcast so much. You can get started with any episode and binge it
all the way, this one is a bit harder to listen to quickly because the
hosts have a faster pace, but it is still really enjoyable.

Destination Linux

I had a bit of an adversion against most of Linux focused podcasts, I
felt that they would talk about the same things over and over, and I was
already quite repetitive with the Linux content I watch on video format.
But DL proved me wrong! There are multiple hosts who talk about their
Linux Journey week after week, and they have formed quite a big
community, a network of fans and Linux enthusiasts, the podcast is quite
cozy and the audio quality is fantastic, I find the intro music super
cringe, but its tolerable enough. I really recommend this one if you are
a fan of Linux and FOSS.

Website RSS Link

The WAN Show

You can think whatever you want about Linus Media Group, but this
podcast is just great. Listening to the hot takes of Linus against
whatever dumb thing a company does each week is super fun, and these
guys really know how to make ad segways seamless, I don‚Äôt even like the
idea of skipping them because of how integrated they are with inside
jokes and charisma. Luke feels like an audience mirror most of the time
eager to see Linus rant about whatever is going on. It is a great show
and I absolutely love it.

Website RSS Link

Wrapping up

I have quite a list of new podcasts compared to the last time I talked
about the topic. I have started to enjoy this format a lot more, right
now I am listening to DL while writing all of this, I gotta admit its
not the best podcast to listen to while writing, but I can deal with it.

If you have not given podcasts a chance, I recommend you to just embrace
them. You can take a look at my previous blog about it if you‚Äôd like to
read some more of my suggestions, I did not went into a lot of detail
there, but I think that I got a bit repetitive here, but I write
whatever I want!

This has been day 52 of #100DaysToOffload

Managing dotfiles has always been quite annoying to me. But thankfully,
I never really had a reason to do it too often. When I moved from Void
Linux to EndeavourOS, all I did was tar my whole .config and copied the
file to an external drive.

That works fine, but it‚Äôs not the best way to backup the constant
changes I usually do to customize the way my programs look or act, and
as a customization freak, that happens quite often.

I had seen many different ways to backup dotfiles: git bare repos, yadm,
symlinking scripts, and of course, GNU Stow.

All of these methods have their up and downs, but in the end, stow
convinced me, and I decided to give it a try. According to their home
page:

  GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages of
  software and/or data located in separate directories on the
  filesystem, and makes them appear to be installed in the same place.

If you don‚Äôt really understand it yet, don‚Äôt worry, I don‚Äôt either! But
in this blog, I will do my best to show you the steps to backup your
current config files, I hope whoever reads this finds it useful.

Creating a dotfiles repository

The first step to backup your dotfiles, is to create an empty repository
in some hosting service, such as GitHub, Codeberg or SourceHut. This is
optional if you only want to see how stow works, but necessary to have
an external backup outside your computer. Once you are done, clone the
empty repo to your home directory, or in any place you want. (This
tutorial will be using the home directory).

To clone a repo, just do:

    git clone https://site.com/link/to/repo

In my case, I use Tildegit, a Gitea instance, so my command looks like
this.

    git clone https://tildegit.org/chrono/dotfiles.git

You can clone my dotfiles if you want to use them, here they are if you
are interested.

Using stow to backup your configuration

Before actually backing something up, we need to install stow, depending
on your distribution, you can install it with your package manager of
choice. In my case, Endeavor is based on Arch, so I do:

    $ sudo pacman -S stow

Lets start by backing up the configuration of a single program. While we
can backup our whole .config folder, that‚Äôs not a good idea, since some
programs store important information that should stay private, and I
think its better to only backup what we have actually configured. For
this example, I will backup my picom configurations.

The first step is to create a new directory to use as a base (if you
cloned your empty repo, you‚Äôll be using that). You also have to create a
folder structure, depending on where you want the configuration to be
stored, this depends on the location the program will read its
configuration from. We‚Äôll refer to this folder as dotfiles.

If you want to add a README file or other stuff that you is not a config
files, you can create another directory inside of dotfiles, in my case,
I have made a stow_home folder, which will be where we‚Äôll run the stow
command. [4]

Lets explain how stow works. Picom expects its config file in
~/.config/picom/picom.conf, so, inside of the new home_stow directory,
we recreate that folder structure, but using the program name (picom)
instead of the tilde (~), which usually refers to the home folder. [5]

Lets put all of this together in the terminal.

    mkdir dotfiles && cd dotfiles # mkdir only if you didn't clone it
    touch README.md other_file.txt # optional
    mkdir -p ~/dotfiles/stow_home/picom/.config/picom/
    mv ~/.config/picom/ ~/dotfiles/stow_home/picom/.config/

Once you do that, your picom folder is no longer in the .config
directory, but inside of dotfiles/home_stow, following the same folder
structure, as if home_stow was the /home directory, followed by the user
picom and the path to the picom configuration files. [6]

Now we repeat this process with all of the files and directories we want
to back up. Once done, the behavior of the programs you use, such as
vim, should revert to their default configurations, since the user
config files are no longer there. So, now its time to fix that! Inside
of stow_home, run the following command:

    stow -vt ~ *

This will symlink everything inside of stow_home [7], targetting ~ as
the starting point. The -v flag will let you know of everything being
done, so you should see an output like this, depending on the programs
you backed up:

    # $ stow -vt ~ *
    LINK: .config/awesome => ../dotfiles/stow_home/awesome/.config/awesome
    LINK: .config/bat => ../dotfiles/stow_home/bat/.config/bat
    LINK: .config/dunst => ../dotfiles/stow_home/dunst/.config/dunst
    LINK: .config/nvim => ../dotfiles/stow_home/nvim/.config/nvim
    LINK: .config/picom => ../dotfiles/stow_home/picom/.config/picom
    LINK: .config/rofi => ../dotfiles/stow_home/rofi/.config/rofi
    LINK: .config/spectrwm => ../dotfiles/stow_home/spectrwm/.config/spectrwm

File versioning with git

If you stumbled upon this guide, you probably know the necesary git
commands to backup everything to the service you chose at the beginning
of this guide.

Generally, everytime you do changes you only need to follow these three
commands, inside of your dotfiles folder.

    git add *
    git commit -m "Added config files"
    git push

Remember that the last command will not work if you don‚Äôt have an
external repository.

The manual of GNU Stow contains a lot more than what I mentioned here,
like unlinking and other flags that can be used and might be useful for
your use case.

Finishing up

Anyways, that‚Äôs all folks, this has been day 54 of #100DaysToOffload,
you can check out my dotfiles if you want to see how stow looks once
setup, besides, my Spectrwm configuration is quite sick if I do say so
myself.

If you feel like a step is not clear enough, please let me know in the
comments or via e-mail.

Secret bonus script!

So, if you read until the end of this blog. I actually did a pretty
decent bash script to automate everything here.

All you need to do is configure it to your liking and run it like this

    dotstow file_or_folder

The script is as follows, it uses basic tools like cut and of course,
stow

    #!/usr/bin/bash
    # Dotstow - Backup your chosen dotfiles in one go using stow.
    # Run it outside of the folder/file you want to back up
    # $ dotstow file-or-program
    # This program was made by joelchrono12

    STOW_DIR=$HOME/dotfiles/stow_home
    DIR=$(pwd | cut -d '/' -f4-)
    NEW_DIR=$STOW_DIR/$1/$DIR
    mkdir -pv $NEW_DIR
    mv -v $1 $NEW_DIR
    cd $STOW_DIR
    stow -vt ~ $1

The program does not check if a folder already exists or anything like
that. So feel free to send any suggestions and changes to it in a
comment or using git send-email to my email address.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I have learned quite a lot of things that I wanted to share here on
my blog. But I did not really feel like I was good enough to mention
them properly without doing a full tutorial or essay about the topic. I
have already talked about a similar problem in previous blogs. Let‚Äôs
catch up on what I have been doing lately, alright?

Switching to dwm

First, I switched to DWM as my tilling window manager of choice. Yeah,
right after I upload my blog showcasing my dotfiles and my spectrwm
configuration, I pick up my stuff, git clone the dwm repo and start
learning how to patch this thing so it does the stuff I want. And guess
what, I couldn‚Äôt be any happier right now. DWM is not the window manager
I wanted, but the one I needed.

Seriously, once its all setup and ready to go, it looks exactly like my
previous spectrwm configuration. However, the bar is better, the tags
are clickable (I know, I am sorry), and (again, I am sorry) I can change
my gaps size on the fly.

I no longer have access to a config file that can be changed on the fly.
But it is still quite easy to read, and building from source is not slow
at all. Besides that, the bar (which I spent most of the time
customizing) is a separate program (aslstatus btw), so I don‚Äôt need to
reboot the WM to see the changes.[8]

Overall, I am really happy with DWM, and I will probably talk more about
it in the future.

More services for my Raspberry Pi

Since my Pi is confined to my local network, I decided to keep playing
around with it and using programs that can be used despite said
limitation.

I already mentioned Pi-hole, which is an ad blocking program that works
in the whole local network. Since then I added radicale, which is a
contact and calendar server that uses CalDAV protocol, I can just save
my contacts on my phone, and using DAVx5 it gets synced as soon as I am
connected to my network.

Rethinking my RSS setup

Another program I decided to try was an RSS server. Something that I
could use and would work with Newsboat, a terminal-based RSS reader that
I believed was local only. But after reading the documentation, I
realized it was able to work with multiple services like Newsblur, Tiny
Tiny Rss, FreshRSS and Miniflux.

At first I tried and enjoyed Newsblur, but after I found the limitations
of the free tier, I decided to use my Pi and find some server to use. I
chose Miniflux, and I am pretty happy with how it turned out.

While the integration with Newsboat was fine. There are not a lot of
apps compatible with Miniflux, at least on F-Droid, the only one
available was Fluent Reader, which looks like an iOS app, and while
functional, didn‚Äôt really fit my style. After some digging on Reddit, I
found out about Miniflutt, which is available on GitHub and, while a
little bare bones, works fine enough. I really like having my read and
starred articles synced across my devices, the kind of feature I didn‚Äôt
know I needed!

Designing some more icons on Inkscape

Of course, I am also making icons for the Arcticons icon pack, while I
don‚Äôt have as much time during school, I have still managed to create a
few icons for some apps, including the Miniflux RSS readers I found. You
can see the pull request here.[9]

Finishing up

So yeah, just a quick catch up, Here is a quick list of another quick
things I did: - I followed a bunch of new RSS feeds from sites that
appear on the Tech News videos from Techquickie. - I am using Emacs and
org mode to take notes for school, because it has a feature to copy and
paste screenshots easily! - I might switch to Vim again because HexDSL
has a script I could modify to do the same thing! - I posted a meme on
Fosstodon and its getting more attention than I expected, I also decided
to make my account locked, so you have to send a follow request. - I am
learning some fun robotics stuff at University, but the site feels like
something made for kids (Visual scripting), I wish they taught us some
real coding.

Anyways, I wrote more than I expected to! This has been day 55 of
#100DaysToOffload. I hope you have a great day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So yeah I don‚Äôt really have a lot of time to make an epic post, and its
been a while since my last one, but well.

Last week our teacher showed us how to create databases using mariadb
and how to manipulate it with Python and the PyMySQL library, so I got
working on it and created my own database.

We had to make some sort of parking lot with 15 spaces to be used by
vehicles, and all I had to do was keep track of which ones were being
used or freed. I did this with a simple database with 15 slots and a
state.

I also had to move a servo-motor so it works as the entrance, it goes up
and down to let cars in and out. I even made it go smoother by making a
for loop and changing the work frequency grade by grade with a timer.

Keeping track of the cars and making sure there are no weird errors was
kinda fun. This project allowed me to experiment with Python, using
stuff that I don‚Äôt really do when using other languages, like try and
exceptions to detect stuff.

For example, when a car exits, I need to know the space it used, and I
don‚Äôt want the code to fail when the user inputs ‚Äú18‚Äù or ‚Äú-4‚Äù. Although
I could just make a few conditional statements, I decided to add an
exception to the IndexError from PyMySQL and take care of stuff that
way.

It was quite a nice experience, I also had to help half a dozen of
classmates who are still not used to the Raspberry Pi and are unwilling
to learn Vim for some weird reason. Anyways, I have had a lot of
homework and a new exam coming up pretty soon, which will be quite a
nightmare for me, since it looks like this semester I am only good at
Embedded Systems‚Ä¶

Anyways, this was post number 56 for #100DaysToOffload, I hope you
enjoyed this quick post which almost feels like a mastodon thread, but
anyways, have a nice day!

So ever since I switched to pass, I have really enjoyed my time and
improved the state of my accounts bit by bit.

By now its old news, but the Twitch leak happened the same day I was
getting my vaccine, and while waiting I talked a friend who was worried
about the security of his account, turns out, both of us as soon as we
woke up changed our passwords and got ready to get the shot (Astra
Zeneca btw).

Regardless, because of this and other conversations in the Fediverse, I
decided to check my accounts once again, change some passwords and
enable multi-factor authentication everywhere I could. I already had a
ton of accounts with it, but I knew I had ignored some sites since I
didn‚Äôt care enough back then, or I didn‚Äôt bother to find the option.

Basically, MFA allows you to get a unique code that changes over time.
This means that even if someone gets access to your password, they only
have 30 seconds to try and guess the code until it changes. Sadly, not
every website implements this feature properly. Twitch for example,
requires you to add your phone number first, even if you don‚Äôt use MFA
via SMS and use an authenticator app, the most recommended way of
getting the codes.

I was sad to see that less than a third of all my online accounts
provided good MFA support. I have like 150 accounts total, and I used to
have a lot more, and while some don‚Äôt really need it (local accounts,
router passwords), there are is a big amount of sites that don‚Äôt even
bother for some reason.

Some interesting places that do not offer Multi-Factor authentication
are the following:

-   Vivaldi: While I really like this browser, the lack of OTP based MFA
    was a little annoying, they have an Encryption password that is just
    a second password apart from the one you set yourself, however, both
    are of the something your know type (which is not enough, at all),
    while MFA is something you have. It looks like there is a thread
    about implementing MFA in their forums, so hopefully the devs work
    on it soon.
-   Matrix: I kinda want to give Matrix a pass, even tho there is no
    TOTP based authentication, it still requires something you have, in
    this case, another device, to authenticate your session and gain
    access to encrypted chats. Still, there is a lot of metadata still
    accessible, which can be very very compromising.
-   Spotify: It does not surprise me at all, this streaming service is
    getting more and more problematic as time goes on. I still use it,
    because it is convenient, and I can‚Äôt afford to pay for music in
    something like Bandcamp. Still, no way to secure an account.
-   HackerNews: This is a news aggregator that is quite similar to
    Reddit. To me, all the data here is basically worthless, I do use it
    but I don‚Äôt comment often. Still, it would be sad to have to remove
    the email alias I assigned to it in case there is some leak.
-   Wikipedia: Well, this is the place I get my homework from. Everyone
    can contribute, there are a lot of articles about basically
    everything. As far as I could tell, while this account is not
    important for me either, no MFA still sucks. Fandom, another Wiki
    used to create sites for specific topics, comics, movies, etc does
    not support it either.

There are many other sites that don‚Äôt have MFA and there are also some
that surprisingly delivered. Stuff like the WCA, which is a site that
keeps tracks of speedcubing competitions and world records is the kind
of website that I would expect to not have the highest security, and
yet, they actually did it. Mathworks and Autodesk also have it, which is
quite surprising, especially taking into account that National
Instruments nor Texas Instruments offer the option (Yes, I study
Engineering btw)

Anyways, this is a friendly reminder to check if you have MFA enabled in
all of your accounts that support it, and its important to encourage the
developers of every account you log into, so they get to work on it.

This has been day 58 of #100DaysToOffload. I once again took a while to
post something, but that‚Äôs how it is sometimes. Anyways, have a good
day!

[1] Being honest, due to how aslstatus works, I feel like it could be
easily used in spectrwm. But I have not tried it, and since DWM works
just fine, I don‚Äôt plan to.

[2] I did not feel like adding pictures to this post, so I just shared a
link where you can see the icons in their full glory (Unless you use
light theme on GitHub, which is disgusting).

[3] If you are unsure about the paths you created, you can run the -n
flag to simulate the output and see exactly where each symlink would be
placed. That way you dont end up symlinking in the wrong place and doing
weird stuff to your filesystem.

[4] Being honest, due to how aslstatus works, I feel like it could be
easily used in spectrwm. But I have not tried it, and since DWM works
just fine, I don‚Äôt plan to.

[5] I did not feel like adding pictures to this post, so I just shared a
link where you can see the icons in their full glory (Unless you use
light theme on GitHub, which is disgusting).

[6] You can also move specific files of a configuration folder. For
example, tut, a mastodon client, saves the account data (passwords, etc)
inside of another file in its configuration folder. if thats the case.
You should move only the files you want, instead of the whole directory.
stow should manage the rest.
