Month after month I keep surprising myself. This June was definitely the month of actually completing things. For once! I managed to turn a quarter of a century old, I managed to complete a book, and three different videogames as well!

I also wrote quite a few blog posts in between the weeknotes and the reviews, which makes me quite happy. Still not as many as March, but that was just a really good streak that broke by the last half, compared to the consistency of this month. I'm happy!

Overall, it was a rollercoaster of emotions, my sister currently studying abroad visited, my parents were travelling for a variety of reasons, my birthday happened, and at the same time, it just felt kind of normal, weird stuff.

Regardless, here is the media I enjoyed throughout the month.

## Podcasts

I listened to a total of 57 hours of podcasts! It's been a relatively quiet month, to be honest.

- **Welcome to Night Vale** - For sleep and not much else, but sometimes the plot is so good I relisten.
- **Into The Aether** - Some great episodes, they recently got rid of ads and went indie again, love it.
- **Darknet Diaries** - I listened to many great stories, Shannen's (Ep. 145) was my favorite.
- **The Ten Minute Bible Hour** - Now at chapter 12 of Matthew, but it remains super interesting.
- **Retro Game Time Machine** - The episodes on *Left 4 Dead* was fun, I always wanted to try it.
- **Dotzip** - The 5 hour long episode about 1000xRESIST, it was beautiful and glorious.
- **The Worst Community Report** - Just some fun banter from people in the Discord server I'm a part of.

## Movies

There were a lot of movies this time around, like, I don't think I've watched as many movies in a single month since I started doing monthly summaries! I've been thinking that I already dedicate a paragraph or so to all of these on my weeknotes, so I'll just stick to one-sentence reviews from now on for media, I think.

- **A Minecraft Movie** - Fun, ridiculous, but uncanny animation, Jack Black has fun.
- **How To Train Your Dragon 3** - Perfect finale, an amazing trilogy and closure to the characters.
- **Arrival** - Cool concepts and amazing visuals with some mind-bending moments.
- **The Fugitive** - Cool thriller with Harrison Ford being chased by Tomy Lee Jones, it can only be fun.
- **Tangled** - Probably the best of the 3D Disney animation movies? Great songs too.
- **Transformers One** - This was a great prequel/origin story and I love it, a rewatch.
- **Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer** - Pure nostalgia for me, amazing VFX for the time though.
- **World War Z** - A zombie movie where they go fast, what were they thinking?
- **Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning** - Thrilling action sequences, convoluted talks in between.

## Anime

It is always a good month when I actually get to complete an anime show, which was the case this time. Even if I don't know if it was best use of my time, I still think that if I enjoyed it, it was worth it.

### Completed
- **Solo Leveling** - Good adaptation, meh animation but it gets a lot better on season two, epic finale.

### Ongoing
- **Mashle Season 2** - Really fun, I love the dub localization, it just makes me laugh, but the action is cool.
- **Death Note** - Only three episodes in, but yeah, it's good! I am going slowly for no real reason, hmm.

## Manga

Quite a few ongoing series! And of course, Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou! I've been having a lot of fun with all these.

- **Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou** - Simply perfect read for the turbulent times of today. Just amazing.
- **How to Grill Our Love** - Wholesome side-character stories for now, still great and cozy.
- **Hunter x Hunter** - Catching up and slowing down, the plot just keeps thickening, good stuff.
- **One Punch Man** - Finally returned to this. New arc is developing, Saitama remains OP.
- **Sakamoto Days** - Fully catched up now, and I am on cliff-hanger, oof. Still, top-notch action here.
- **DanDaDan** - Ridiculously fun arc with tornadoes, while still having incredible character development.

## Books

One finished, one started, not bad, not great. Will the day come when I can read as much as others?

- [**The Big Time**](/blog/the-big-time) - What a weird book to have finished, an interesting work for its time, but confusing for me, as a non-native speaker.
- **Nemesis Games** - Finally started the fifth book of The Expanse. This is off to a great start, since all the characters of the crew are having their own concurrent arcs right now, and they are quite fun and distinct from previous adventures.

## Gaming

![Games](/assets/img/blogs/2025-07-01/games.webp)

Yeah I just love videogames, what an incredible medium. The games I completed represent many facets of my taste and I had a blast with all of them. It is extremely weird for me to just roll credits three times in a month, but it was worth it.

### Completed

- [**1000xRESIST**](/blog/1000xresist) - Maybe my favorite game this year? It definitely looks like it.
- [**Ys: The Oath in Felghana**](/blog/ys-the-oath-in-felghana) - An incredible action rpg that ticks all the boxes, recommended.
- [**Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow**](/blog/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow) - What a Metroidvania, an amazing entry that's remains among the best.

### Ongoing

- **Hollow Knight** - I am in the endgame now, exploring as many corners I can find because I want to enjoy this game as much as possible. I will face the final boss some time soon! Maybe some of the extra bosses as well.
- **Dragon Quest XI** - Still charmed by this story, I played hours this month, and I've made it to a pretty big moment of the story. This game just sparks joy.
- **Final Fantasy VI** - I also progressed a lot here, made it to the second half of the game, and it's so good, holds up great today. Gotta level up my characters though.
- **Full Metal Furies** - The current choice with my couch gaming friends. it's been great to fight cool bosses and hordes of enemies.
- **Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade** - I didn't really play it much, but I intend to complete the story this month to be done with it.
- **Monster Hunter Rise** - Did a high rank mission and realized I really need to upgrade my equipment.
- **Super Mario 3D World** - Just some levels here and there.

### Shelved

- **Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver Remastered** - I got this on Steam but it got picked for October in my gaming club, so I decided to play it until then, the original voice acting and the remastered graphics are super good though.

## Device Usage

### Laptop

I used my laptop for a total of 75 hours. Not a lot to say here, I use my computer at work a lot more lately, for obvious reasons.

- Firefox for 37 hours
- Zen Browser for 14 hours
- Alacritty for 10 hours
- Signal for 2 hours
- PPSSPP for 1 hour

### Phone

I used my phone for a total of 252 hours. That is *definitely a problem*, I've been way too active on Fosstodon and Polymaths Social this time. At least I cut down on YouTube consumption and the like. I also returned to some mainstream social media lately, but at least I didn't use them much, ugh.

- Tusky for 42 hours
- Fennec for 41 hours
- Mattermost for 28 hours
- Tubular for 25 hours
- Signal for 21 hours
- Discord for 17 hours
- WhatsApp for 16 hours
- Mihon for 8 hours
- Instagram for 7 hours
- Lite for 5 hours
- Reddit for 2 hours

### Kobo

Not a lot of reading compared to other months, it's a bit of a shame, but it's the cost of finishing so many videogames! Time ends up going somewhere else.

I read 291 pages in 6 hours and 10 minutes

- The Big Time for 2 hours and 10 minutes, 96 pages
- Nemesis Games for 4 hours, 195 pages


## Final thoughts

Not a lot to add this time around. I hope you guys have a great day. Thank you for reading this post. What were you up to this month?

This is day 92 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
