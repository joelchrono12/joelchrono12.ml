This month was spent consuming various kinds of media, unlike last month. I feel like I could have been more productive, as always. But well, it is how it is. I really need to put myself together though. Let's hope for the best. For now, here's what I did this month, more or less.


## Podcasts

Alright, I listened to a variety of different podcasts this time, so there they are!


- __Dungeons and Daddies__: Once again, after starting the first few episodes last month, I ended up catching up to the current season, so now I am in pain waiting for the next episode.
- __Sir Khan__: A Spanish podcast/YouTube channel that has amazing shows talking about Warhammer 40K lore and stories. Super awesome! His narration of the most intense moments of the Horus Heresy actually made me cry.
- __Into The Aether__: I listened to a few episodes this time around. Not too many!
- __Late Night Linux__: I actually listened to some more of these as well, always entertaining.

## Books

- __Pride and Prejudice__: This is a classic book that I started reading and listening, but I am still not done with it. Its quite funny to be honest, I just have to give it more time.

- __First and Only__: In the grim darkness of the dark future, there is only WAR! This is a Warhammer novel featuring the Imperial Guard, normal guys trying to survive against demons and aliens thrice their size. But they got tanks and mass, and yeah, I just got started on this one too.


## Movies and Series

- __Elysium__: This is a sci-fi movie with Matt Damon complaining about Health Care not being free in the future, where the whole world looks like Mexico. And I am here for it.
- __Wispher of the Heart__: Now this was a beautiful film. I watched it with my siblings and friends and it was really a joy to watch. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, and I hope it stays that way as I go through the Studio Ghibli movies

## Anime

- __Giant Beasts of Ars__: This is the original anime you need. No manga, no spoilers, and an original story that merges Attack on Titan with a world that kinda feels like Avatar: The Last Airbender without elements. Also some weird sci-fi stuff that somehow fits despite everything else looking ancient. Kinda like Breath of the Wild? Idk. But the story is good and characters are good. The show is still airing, so I am not done yet! Sadly the animation is not as great, but its definitely above average.

- __Lycoris Recoil__: A secret organization in Japan uses teen girls to fight crime and keep Tokyo safe. I don't know how this works, but it does, and the animation is top notch. Nice mistery and action sequences, adorable cast and interesting plot. I am not done with it yet!


## Manga

- __Chi no Wadachi__: I hadn't read this one in a while. The less you know about this one, the better. Its a bit depressing and full of bad people going through bad times. But the choices made by the characters are always intriguing and you never know what's really going on in their heads. I catched up to it!
- __Komi Can't Communicate__: Always wholesome and nice to read. Catched up to it!
- __One Punch Man__: This one never fails to entertain me, I am a bit behind though.

## Device Usage

This month I used my devices a bit less than the previous one, which I find interesting. To be fair a bit of my time was spent on Windows, where I don't have m ActivityWatch installed, so maybe I just transitioned my usage from one place to another.

### Desktop usage

I used my laptop for a total of 154 hours.

- Used Firefox for 109 hours
- Used Alacritty for 21 hours
- Used GIMP for 6 hours

### Android Usage

I used my device for a total of 171 hours.

- Used Newpipe for 34 hours
- Played for Brawl Stars for 24 hours
- Used Mastodon clients for 16 hours
- Read on Librera for 12 hours
- Read on Tachiyomi for 5 hours
- Watched on Aniyomi for 4 hours

## Final words

That's pretty much it. I also started playing on a PSP for a bit, but I'll write about that later, I guess.
