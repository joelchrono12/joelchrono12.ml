Years ago at this point in time, I used to be a bit of a security and privacy enthusiast. I like to thing I still follow many good practices and measures to live a good, responsible internet life. However, there are other many aspects of this where I kind of stopped caring.

Don't get me wrong, I will still use different passwords and enable 2FA for 95% or so of the accounts and websites I use. But there are other things I stopped doing and while I know I should probably put more effort on them, I just haven't bothered.

For example, **using email aliases** is something I don't really do except for very specific usecases. Most of the time I use one of 5 or 6 legit emails instead of trying to use one of the services I literally _already used_ such as [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/), [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io) or at least [DuckDuckGo's](https://duckduckgo.com/email).

Another thing I should really do is **delete my unused accounts**, this was [one of my first blogposts](/blog/cleanup-your-pwmanager/) and it's kind of nostalgic looking back at younger me writing so enthusiastically about having a responsible digital life or whatever. I would love if you guys check it out as well, it still has some good advice!

Despite it all, one of the things I still manage to do sometimes is **keeping my family members' accounts in check**, ever since [I moved my parents to using more FOSS](/blog/moving-my-parents-towards-security-and-foss/) like a password manager, they have managed to keep at it, and when they move devices I usually help them retrieve the important info from them as well.

My password manager of choice is still [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org), at some point [I was using pass](/blog/pass-unix-manager/), but those days are long gone now. I have a little too many devices and managing PGP can be a bit annoying. I still use pass in some scripts but nowhere near as often as before, I think it's still a pretty neat password manager to be honest, maybe I'll revisit it...? Nah. I'm good.
