For a long time, I have been using the same set of categories for all of my feeds.

There are those for news, comics and project updates,  as well as one for Personal Websites.

Later on, I also created a category for all the websites doing [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com), like me.

This has been the case for 3 years.

What has not been the case for 3 years, is the quantity! The amount of blog posts I follow has grown by a lot. I am susbcribed to 250 websites, more or less, and I constantly adding more to the mix. There really are [a lot of feeds to follow](/blog/so-many-feeds-to-follow/).

Obviously, a couple of categories is not really sustainable anymore. Not everyone posts at the same rate, and sadly, I don't have the time to read every single thing every single person I follow writes.

There's also the problem of some bloggers writing with more frequency than others, with different levels of relevance as well.

[Ruben Schade](https://rubenerd.com) posts a lot of stuff at all times, which means he'll show up much more regularly than [Mike Sass](https://flamedfury.com) who doesn't post that often.

There's also [HexDSL](https://dandelion-utilitarian.com) or [Hollie](https://eilloh.net) who share micro-thoughts or drawings more than regular posts, which means that they have a lot of entries on their feeds, and even if they're quick to read, they take more screen space than I'd like.

And of course, there are those bloggers that will take *ages* before they publish something, like [Hund](https://hunden.linuxkompis.se) or [Analog Office](https://analogoffice.net), sometimes they share some absolute bangers, sometimes it's a simple post catching up, letting us know they're still around. Whatever the case, I don't want to miss out!

Chatting with [Amin](https://benjaminhollon.com), he told me he has some categories based on how much he values the posts to read them later, be it weeks, or just a few days. He has Gold, Silver and Bronze!

He told me I am in the Silver category, so from now on my current goal is to achieve Gold status some day---the odds are against me though, because he has very high standards. ðŸ¥²

Anyway, I don't think three categories is enough for the volume of blog posts I get every week. I could trim down the feeds, let go of some of them that I don't follow that much. But that's too easy.

I've created a few categories that I'll try to improve over time, right now it's something like this:

- Blogging Friends: for people I interact with often, regardless of how often they post.
- Sporadic Bloggers: for those that really take a while to post stuff, I moved a couple friends here to not miss out on them.
- 100DaysToOffload: People who are doing, or have completed the challenge already.
- Blogs in Spanish: I follow so few people writing in Spanish I just grouped them all. If you have recommendations let me know!
- TWG Discord: Members from the only Discord server I actually interact with, that also have blogs, kinda specific but it works.
- Reviewers: This one is kinda empty, but it's pretty clear what it will contain, for games or books alike.

I still have to actually move plenty of feeds around to the correct categories, but I think it's a decent start. How do you guys do it?

This is day 63 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
