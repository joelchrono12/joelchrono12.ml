A few years ago, I wrote about [what's on my phone](/blog/whats-on-my-phone-fall-2023). Today, after a single chat with [R.L. Dane](https://rldane.space) talking about how he doesn't want his Signal backups to be more than 1.5 GB, I checked the size of my Signal storage use, and realized *it's more than 2.5 GB*. From there, I decided to take a look at how much space is taken over in my phone, and by what apps or files... *and what does that say about me as a person?*

To get the specific storage usage by folder, I used [Solid Explorer](https://neatbytes.com/solidexplorer/), which has a pretty simple setting to view it at a glance. The rest I got from Android's app settings section.

For obvious privacy reasons---*and lazyness to be honest*---I won't be too specific about everything, but I'll share what isn't that big of a deal.

My current phone has 128 GB of built-in memory, I remember back then how I was happy with my Redmi 5A's 32 GB, and 16 GB MicroSD card sometimes. *Oh how the times have changed...*

Anyway, the Internal storage I have access to, consists of 105 GB, and I have 7.37 GB left *for now.*

## Folders by size

- **Manga - 13.6 GB**: I read a lof of manga on my phone, so I download it in advance, I've done a pretty bad job at managing it. There are many chapters I've already finished but didn't delete. There's an auto-delete feature in the app I use, but I didn't enable it until a month or so ago. I have the first 20 or so chapters ready to go of many series I haven't started yet. I still have all of *Death Note* and *Monster* downloaded, they are masterpieces, but maybe I should not fill up my phone with them.
- **Signal Backups - 7.86 GB**: Being in two fairly active Signal groups, and having two backups stored makes it so all of this space is used on that. I truly enjoy looking back on these chats from time to time, as well as personal ones, I should probably delete the old media taking up space when it isn't necessary anymore though.
- **Music - 7.43 GB**: This is all the local music I have on my phone, I also have some downloaded inside apps, which will be shown later, *Queen* and *Daft Punk* are take like 1.3 GB each, then *Mariya Takeuchi* and *Miki Matsubara* with 500 MB each, all of them are `.flac`, the rest of artists are MP3 or have less songs. 
- **DCIM - 5.86 GB**: Everyone knows this folder, it's just photos and videos taken on my phone and not much else. The largest file here is a timelapse of a badminon match with my sister, the second is a video of the last round of a match of *Spoons* with friends.
- **Pictures - 3.36 GB**: These are mostly edited photos with Snapseed (like 500 MB) and Screenshots (like 1.5 GB), I really should clean these up...
- **Android  - 2.15 GB**: Just media from WhatsApp chats, not super interesting stuff.
- **Download 1.8 GB**: I have a little too many PSP games downloaded here for no reason, I should just transfer them to my PSP already. I also had some zipped Music which I had already transferred to the Music folder.
- **Backups - 1.33 GB**: This is a synced folder (using [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net)), with my Threema backups, backup files from different apps, contacts and pictures, as well as my [keepass](https://keepassxc.org/) database. Mostly random stuff.
- **Anime - 1.27 GB**: I have some episodes of *Gurren Lagann*, *Dr Stone* and *Ace of Diamond* I should have already watched. Will clean up after I'm done writing this.
- **Videos - 1.17 GB**: Here is where my downloads from [Tubular](https://github.com/polymorphicshade/Tubular) (a [Newpipe](https://newpipe.net/) fork) go, or random videos and screen recordings.
- **Syncthing - 2.02 GB**: Files I keep in sync with my laptop and family, mostly church presentations, books, song chords, and pdf files.
- **Books - 136 MB** Back when I read books on my phone, I still have them just in case.
- **Documents - 67 MB** Here are my markdown files edited with Markor, and some other random documents, I should probably move this stuff to my synced folder one of these days...

## Apps by size

I have plenty of folders, but I still think most of my storage is being used by apps with a lot of internal data on them, so here are the top 10 just for fun. I'll leave the few games I got for later, and I'll skip system apps.

- **AntennaPod** - 5.29 GB, yeah... a lot of downloaded episodes I haven't gone through, plus auto-downloads every week!
- **WhatsApp** - 3.27 GB, welp.
- **Signal** - 2.93 GB, even though I only have like 10 active chats and groups, I got quite a lot of data on it!
- **RiMusic** - 2.03 GB, a YT Music alternative frontend with some downloaded music on it.
- **Threema Libre** - 1.7 GB, I think I am in too many public groups I don't even use much compared to Signal, time for some cleaning up here.
- **Fennec** - 1.05 GB, my web browser of choice, pretty good, I think some of this would clean up just by deleting Downloads.
- **Nintendo Music** - 578 MB, what can I say, they have a great collection of sountracks from my childhood.
- **Telegram** - 425 MB, I guess keeping most of my chats in their cloud helps.
- **Bank** - 300 MB, hm.
- **Element** - 284 MB, I am actually surprised, although I barely use Matrix anymore, maybe talk to me there! or XMPP, Conversations is only like 70 MB.

## Games by size

Most other games are well below 200 MB and I'd rather save them for a blog post focused on that later, if I feel like it. Right now all of them are in danger of deletion anyway since I barely play them.

- **Brawl Stars** - 1.67 GB, a game I haven't opened much in a while, but I still don't want to delete it.
- **Dicey Dungeons** - 1.16 GB, a fully offline and complete game, a deck-builder roguelike which is lots of fun!
- **Marvel Snap** - 0.98 GB, a deck-building and card collecting game with a lot of things to unlock and great mechanics.

## Finishing thoughts

When I was a youngling I remember being like "why do you need so much space in your phone?", and well, look at me now, I am holding up just because I am not that big of a photo taker or a music listener. There's people out there who need 256 GB on their phones, that's crazy to me, but then again, needing more than 32 GB was crazy for me 7 years ago.

Still, I think I can clean this up pretty easily, maybe compressing some pictures or transferring them to some external storage medium.

I really should look into some backup solutions off-site and such, both for this and my laptop, could be fun to setup at some point.
