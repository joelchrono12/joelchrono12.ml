Yesterday I decided to move to [Vercel](https://vercel.app) for my website hosting. I had heard about it a while ago, and after [a post I saw on my local timeline](https://fosstodon.org/@thatzacdavis/109640022382097725) I remembered hearing about it and ended up setting it up yesterday, as I [mentioned on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@joel/109640467182046296)

Eventually, I remembered I first heard about Vercel on [a post by Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/comparing-static-site-hosts-best-host-for-a-static-site/) where he compared multiple hosting providers. Vercel ended up on top when it comes to speed and the like, even if it lacks some of the features Netlify has.

I had been experiencing very slow build times, it kinda felt like Netlify was reinstalling the whole Jekyll environment everytime it built my blog or something like that. I was meaning to look into fixing it and I even considered moving to something like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), but after trying Vercel I have to say I am really impressed, doing the change was pretty easy, and getting my domain configured only took a couple minutes, even if the change took a while to apply in the network, so if you tried to access my blog recently and it failed, that's why.

Regardless, another thing I was thinking about was how I rarely get email replies from people, I actually kind of like those, but the quick link to do so is only visible from my website. I will not remove my Mastodon comments or anything as extreme, but since I am aware quite a bit of my readers follow me via [my RSS feed](https://joelchrono12.xyz/feed.xml), I added a special link to quickly reply from there. Which you'll see from this post onward, maybe that'll reduce the friction. Anyways, I'm kinda easy to reach out from other places anyway.
