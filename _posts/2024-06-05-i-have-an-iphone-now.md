I have met with a terrible fate, haven't I?

I never thought the day would come, but it did.

My workplace assigned me an iPhone SE, and I had no choice but to accept it.

Sadly, there were no other options available, other than iPhone 15 models which are reserved for the higher ups anyway---would've been nice though.

Today I went to buy a case and a screen protector for it, since I don't want it to get damaged, since it is not even my property anyway and my workplace didn't include one---would've been nice, though.

I have to say, if there's one thing I found charming about this device, it is the screen size. It is totally tiny and adorable compared to my regular phone, and having huge black bars in the top and bottom, as well as a home button in the front is rather nostalgic, despite the fact that I never had an iPhone before.

Also, just because I am barely allowed to install things on it and the like, doesn't mean I'm not going to customize it to whatever degree Apple will let me, I don't think I'll share it or anything since it will probably just be the same wallpaper I already have on my other phone, but still, just letting you know.

Regardless, no need to worry dear reader, I'll still be using my trusty Android device for the time being.
