These past few weeks, I've gotten a lot more emails than I did during all of the previous year! It is still a very manageable amount though, so I decided to answer most of them today! If you are reading this and you have sent me an email, check your inbox! ;)

Some of them were related to my [feed organization struggles](/blog/trying-to-organize-my-feeds), some of them are about my thoughts on [constantly seeking entertaining](/blog/the-constant-need-for-entertainment), a few others, old friends, and people I've emailed before, all of them were really nice to read. ^^

This was a nice way to remember that there's people who read me, and it has encouraged me to keep on writing for those who have found me worthy. It's nice to know that it's not just bots crawling around my archives, but real human beings surfing the web and seeking to interact and communicate with each other.

I have not asked for your permission, so I will not mention names, but you know who you are, and I appreciate you. Feel free to let me know if you don't mind a mention, so I update this post with your website and keep expanding this little web of ours.

Knowing that I've also inspired some people to create websites, and to participate in challenges and respond to my posts with their own articles, brings me joy! I've tried to read what I can, and to send emails back as well.

This is what the web is all about.
