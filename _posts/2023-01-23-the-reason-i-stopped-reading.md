I honestly had to idea of what to write today so this will have to do.

I've been reading quite a bit over the years. My goal is to read at least 15 books this year. You can track my progress by following me on my [Bookwrym account](https://bookrastinating.com/user/joel). The truth is, that I got back into gaming a bit more. I've enjoyed playing [Brawl Stars for quite a while]({{ site.url }}/blog/my-first-brawl-stars-challenge-win/) and a recent update that removed a lot of the gambling aspects that plague so many of today's mobile videogames, got actually removed!

This made it so I started playing a lot more often, from only weekends to 15 or 30 minutes per day. I wouldn't say it was the reason I stopped reading but it definitely didn't help.

The initial reason is, that the book I'm reading [I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream](https://bookrastinating.com/book/399803/s/i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream) by Harlan Ellison. Is a collection of short stories, and I've enjoyed it so much. Each story has a very short introduction to them, and the problem is that the author just said that the next story, titled *Lonelyache*, is actually what he considers to be one of the best stories he's ever written. For some reason my mind started hyping it up a lot, and I just haven't gotten myself to reading it.

Be it because I don't consider myself worthy enough of reading such a story, or because I am actually afraid of being dissapointed due to my own expectations, the truth of the matter is that I have spent a ton of time without having any progress on my reading goals. So I will read this and probably finish it tomorrow, to at least complete two books this month.

This was a short useless post, but aren't they all? Until next time!
