This week was pretty unique, I had a few days of vacation, which I used for plenty of stuff, and things I didn't really expect to happen. So, here are some of them.

- üîó I answered a bunch of Blog Question Challenges this week, for [technology](/blog/blog-questions-technology-edition), [TV shows](/blog/questions-tv-shows) and [my own name](/blog/whats-in-a-name). They were quite fun to answer! I think I'll write my own soon.
- üñ•Ô∏è Work was extremely relaxing last week, I only worked from Monday to Wednesday, and I barely had anything to do, because most of the production lines were on hold. I read quite a bit during those couple days, and wrote blog posts ;)
- üè° I had vacations due to Easter, and had a well deserved rest from work during the rest of the week, my parents went on a trip without me, so I had the house for myself and really enjoyed being home alone for a while.
- üé∂ I don't know why I got into scrobbling my music again, I've always done it on my phone, but I added a web extension for my browser and set up a small script on my website to display my last listened song. It's kinda fun!
- üåê I added a new [/links](/links/) [slashpage](https://slashpages.net/) to my website, it does not have any fancy descriptions or explanations, it's just a bunch of lists that will feature direct links to websites, only way to know what they are is to click I guess!
- ü•∑ [I use Arch now](/blog/i-use-arch-btw), already wrote my thoughts about it in my last post. I took my time to set everything up again, and so far I'm really happy with it, it reignited some of the enjoyment I had during my first days using Linux in Pop_OS, or my jump to Void a little more recently.
- ‚åö I ordered a new wrist watch, it should arrive next week. [Dusan]() shared he got a Casio Royale, and it was a new dark gray variant so I had to get it...


## üïπ Gaming

- **Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow** - Other than beating Death and exploring some more of the castle, I actually didn't play that much, I was so lazy, I didn't even log my playtimes in backloggd yet!
- **Full Metal Furies** - This is another one of those I bought to play with friends, but we are actually having a blast with it. It's similar to *[Castle Crashers](https://www.castlecrashers.com)* and was developed by the guys who made *Rogue Legacy*. It is very focused on having everyone be essential to the team. There are enemies only certain characters can defeat, which makes it so victory is not achieved by fighting alone, it has some nice RPG elements to it as well, I'm having fun.
- **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time** - *ooooo boy*, I don't know why I thought this was a good idea. But I decided to play the beginning of Ocarina of Time out of nowhere, I got to talk with the Deku Tree and decided to leave it at that. That game feels good on the Switch, but I kind of wanna set it up on Linux and play it with all the goodies of Ship of Harkinian.

## üìñ Reading

- **Cibola Burn** - Read up to chapter 36, not as many as I could have during the vacation time, but I was too busy installing Arch on my laptop. The plot is getting pretty serious right now, I'm hyped and terrified of how it'll evolve.
- **Uncle from Another World** - Read up to chapter 17. I wanted a bit of a change and continued this, still following what I watched of the anime, which is pretty fun.

- [The ARCH LINUX Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urYjGtnfckM) - I watched all of the vidoes by this guy installing Linux, they were genuinely great videos from a normal guy trying to get around common issues people can find when trying Linux. He did one for Vim, the Arch installation itself, Window managers and others!
- [Death of a Beloved Arch Linux Based Distro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkW1ZUp9lvo) - ArcoLinux is no more, and this video by Brodie was quite the way to find out. It is one of the reasons I decided to install Arch as well!
