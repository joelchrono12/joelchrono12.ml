One of the blogs I often read but haven't mentioned much is [Alexandra Wolfe's](https://wrywriter.ca), she recently had some thoughts [regarding names](https://wrywriter.ca/posts/whats-in-a-name) and left some questions to answer ourselves! Therefore, this blog post.

It's almost like I keep finding question challenges to answer day after day! 

## Do you like your name?

I do actually! I think Joel is a pretty cool name, it is kind of popular but not super popular, somewhere in the top 150 in Mexico, from what I found online. It means "Yahweh is God", which makes sense to me :P

## Do people regularly misspell/mispronounce your name?

It was fairly common to be called "Jose" from time to time, by people glancing at my name in a list or something. Whenever I introduced myself, they would sometimes hear names like "Noe"---Noah in Spanish---or even just the last syllable "El"---"He" in Spanish. 

I've even gotten mail directed to "Jose" at least once, nothing too bad though.

## If you were going change your name to anything else, what would you choose?

No idea, I'd like to keep the letter J to be honest, maybe James or Jack but like, I'm fine as is.

## Do you go by your first name?

Yep, Joel is my first name.

## Do you have a middle name?

Yes I do, won't tell~

## Do you have a nickname?

It depends, at work... *nah*, sometimes I'm called Junior for reasons you can assume. Sometimes I've been called Jo, which is not great in Spanish but makes sense in English I think. I'm also called Jojoy by family, in Spanish, don't ever call me that in English.

[Michael](https://mihobu.lol/whats-in-a-name) also added a couple of extra sections to this challenge, which are the following!

## Random Opinion

I wish my name pronounced in English was the same as in Spanish (kinda like "Ho-ell") instead of "Joule/Yoel" or whatever.

## Bonus Fact
I said I won't tell my middle name, but if you are curious, it ends with "el" too.
