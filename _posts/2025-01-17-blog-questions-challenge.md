I was nominated by [RLDane](https://rldane.space/blog-questions-challenge-2025.html) and [Adamsdesk](https://www.adamsdesk.com/posts/blog-questions-challenge-2025) to participate on this challenge. Even though I already have many things to write about, I thought it would be fun, let's get started!

## Why did you start blogging in the first place

During covid lockdown, I got into too many hobbies at once, game development, coding in general, GNU/Linux and open source software (due to Godot Engine) and also the Fediverse, where I joined Fosstodon---and many other instances at the same time, because that's what a newbie does when they join fedi.
Anyway! From there I found out many blog posts, I somehow stumbled upon the [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) challenge, and started my own blog on a whim using Kev's guide to [start a blog with Jekyll and SimpleCSS](https://kevquirk.com/blog/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css)

From there, the rest is history! I had lots of time during the pandemic, so I managed to complete the challenge, and I have done so three times by now, it's great.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog, and why do you use it?

I have stuck with Jekyll since the beginning, and it has worked great for me, I've never really bothered with anything else, not Hugo, not Zola, not Pelican, or any other SSG.

The closest has been [blop](https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop), which I used on a mirror of this blog post for a while that is no longer updated, since I started to use some of Jekyll's features more extensively, which made mirroring to a different ssg a bit of a pain. As I said though, I have no plans to move to a different platform at the moment.

I use it because it works well, I have developed my own workflow by writing scripts and tools to deal with most of the caveats using Jekyll could have, like adding images or creating a post from scratch, or sharing the link to my social media once I'm done with it. There's many sections on my blog making use of Liquid syntax or Jekyll includes, and they just work, so why change it?

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

I had a couple of Blogger sites back in the day, I used to be a fan of Club Penguin, and also a kid with no money to spare, so I just made a website where I shared all the free stuff one could get playing the game, of course, copy pasted from different sites.

I also had a different site with Origami tutorials and diagrams that I shared for everyone to see. I think most of what I shared there was without permission, but I didn't really know better at the time.

Both websites are long gone nowadays, only a few posts were shared on each. Blogging itself and actually writing didn't really click for me yet. 
 
Despite it all, I learned a good bit about HTML and graphic design! Looking things up on my own and the like. Good times, I miss Club Penguin. 

## How do you write your posts?

At home, Neovim, with the goyo plugin to add margins to the text.
At work, Notepad++, since it's the only decent editor available, I found a styling for Markdown syntax that is decent enough.
In my phone, Markor. It's a pretty great markdown editor for android, does all it needs to do.

Most of the time I do a final edit on my laptop, in case I missed any typos or metadata for the post, since publishing and formatting is easier from there.

## When do you feel the most inspired to write?

Lately, during any dead times I have at work, I write. I have a lot of topics in mind at this moment, but I usually check my RSS feeds to find some topic where I I have something to say.

Many times, I fall into a rabbithole, and it takes over my blog. For example, when I bought my Miyoo Mini Plus and did a lots of things with it; a review, game and save file management, my own theme and my own game cover designs. I wrote about all those because I felt passionate about it.

Other times, a particular thought lingers on my mind, some action I did, some experience I had; so I just decide to share it here because I don't want it to just dissapear. They are more rare and personal, so I think they're worth sharing.

## Do you normally publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer?

I publish as soon as I finish a post, and I almost always finish a post in the same day. I just write quickly I guess, sometimes I have typos or bad grammar that I didn't notice, but I just edit it later and call it a day. It's my website, it's no big deal.

## What's your favorite post on your blog?

I have a hard time chooosing like everyone does, but I will just share the first post that came to mind.

[My Dune review](/blog/dune)! I don't know, it just felt like writing a little journey throughout my experience with that universe before I watched the movies and the book, it was kinda fun.

My actual favorite I'm still undecided, probably one of the many I write describing a random day of my life, like [this one](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/2024-10-10-morning-before-work/) or where I recall memories of my past, such as [this one](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/first-contact-with-emulation/), yeah, probably those.

## Any future plans for the blog?

I really like my current color scheme, I really like most of my current structure. I'd like to add better statistics for the blog, like words per month and things like that.

I'd also like to unify all of my gaming and manga tracking, maybe parse it from the websites I currently use, or find one with a good API I can use instead.

Oh yeah, and a search bar for my website! One day.
