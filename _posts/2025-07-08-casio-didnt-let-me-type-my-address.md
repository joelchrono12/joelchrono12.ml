I've probably done way too much online shopping this month (and the previous one too) for a variety of reasons, from many different sellers, and to add to the injury, I am also expecting some packages from normal people as well!

After asking for a refund for [the fake watches I got online](/blog/2025-w27/#fake-casios-strikes-once-again), I decided to get replacements via Casio's official website. When I filled in my home address, I noticed that when I typed in the colony (a neighborhood in MÃ©xico, btw), it was truncated to a certain amount of characters when I clicked a different part of the page.

I typed the colony last and hit submit, hoping maybe that would work. 

*It did not*.

The next day, I saw an email from an employee or something for the logistics company that delivers Casio products, asking me to reply back and send the proper address. I thought this was a bit weird, but I replied with the corrected information anyway, since they already knew the incomplete address information, I also pointed out that the website limited the amount of characters I could type in the address box, so they might want to fix that. I hit sent and it was done.

However, I noticed they had CC'd a different email, at first I was scared, but noticed it was from casio.com, so, no biggie, I decided to forward my reply to them too, just in case.

For some reason, at my workplace, "Reply All" is the default everyone expects, so I thought that might be the case for them too. Since I missed it at first, I thought the forward would be fine.

Would you see my surprise, when a completely different employee replied to my email, thanking me for this information and *escalating it* with the corresponding department. In my head, I was like *am I getting people in trouble??*---it felt like I was.

Finally, the original employee replied back with my tracking number, and a few minutes later, a more proper, automated email from Casio showed up as well.

Maybe it's just me, but I feel like I caused a bit of a ruckus there, maybe they will update their website so the character limit is removed, or maybe the original employee just got busy and someone else replied at that time.

Honestly, probably nothing happened, it was just my brain being weird about it and overthinking things. I can imagine these people in the same office or maybe working from home, reading my little complaint, maybe they take it seriously, or as a joke, as passive aggressive, or way too formal.

In any case, it's probably not a big deal, I imagine it's not common for them to have to correct address information due to a website bug (most addresses aren't as long, after all), but I also don't think it's nothing new. And it's just a bit of me worrying about being a nuisance, when people are just doing their jobs and are used to worse things.

I have no idea what will happen over there, but at least my watches are arriving home soon!
