Besides the previous [blog questions challenge about technology](/blog/blog-questions-technology-edition), I also just decided to participate on this one, about TV shows! Let's just go for it and just write whatever comes to my head first and see how it goes!

Before actually answering the questions, I'd like to name some of the TV shows that come to my head at this time. I will not include anime, k-dramas (only watched like 2 anyway) or cartoons, I will include shows only available on streaming platforms as well.

- Daredevil
- Doctor Who
- Malcom in the Middle
- Star Trek (TOS and TNG)
- The Flash
- The Arrow
- Law & Order
- Young Sheldon
- George & Mandy
- Superman & Lois
- Stranger Things
- The Returned
- Friends
- Drake & Josh
- iCarly
- Victorious
- Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide
- Sherlock
- Legends of Tomorrow

Those are the ones that came to my mind, I think there's some others but I didn't really watch enough to be sure. For example, I know I watched like 20 or so random episodes of *The Big Bang Theory* and I have a general idea of how it evolved over time, but I haven't really watched it, same goes for *House M.D.* and other shows. *Law & Order* gets a pass because, well, it is what it is. The rest I watched fully, or at least until their new seasons got bad, looking at *Doctor Who* and *The Flash*...

## What TV character from a beloved show do you wish you could be best friends with in real life?

This one is difficult, the answer did not come to my head at all, but I will keep writing until something comes up. *I'm thinking, I'm thinking*, but I still have nothing. I want to say a character from *Malcom in The Middle*, but maybe not.

I think I'll have to go with... nope, not yet. Sheldon...? I haven't even watched *The Big Bang Theory* properly yet. Maybe Georgie from *Young Sheldon*? Nah probably not, I think I will have to go with *OH WAIT, NOW I KNOW...*

**The Doctor!** from *Doctor Who*! Oh man, that would be *awesome*, I think I'd make for a pretty cool companion and friend travelling through *time* and *space...* although it would be really dangerous. *Hmm, let me think a bit more.*

Matt Murdock from *Daredevil*? A bit too gritty and not a lot of quality friendship time would be available, ~~and I may end up kidnapped somehow~~. Still thinking, still thinking...

Maybe from a sitcom show I have watched, should I return to *Malcom in the Middle*? It's my favorite show (spoilers I guess) but to be friends with any of them? they are all such a troublesome bunch, I am not sure. I am an adult now after all, are we assuming that the characters grow up outside of the show too? If so... nope.

I'm literally clueless right now. OH RIGHT I KNOW WHO.

No, I don't, just me fooling myself into knowing something hoping it works as a placebo.

*A minute later...*

Still nothing. Welp.

Alright, alright, *I'll have to pick the option I wanted to avoid at all costs*. I would want to be friends with...

**AAAAAAAAAH I STILL DON'T KNOW**, I was trying to force myself into thinking something again (didn't work).

Characters from Star Trek feel like too safe of a choice, ~~and I would feel like a poser as I haven't actually half of the episodes in the TOS and TNG series...~~ so maybe not.

*I'm knocking my head against the keyboard right now (figure of speech).*

**CISCO!**

_**No**, not the company that sells modems and stuff._

Cisco Ramon from *The Flash*! Yeah! That guy! he seems pretty funny and he is a nerd and does lots of hackery stuff, at least in the early seasons. Yeah I think I'd like to be friends with him!

Now I'm overthinking it, but no! I will stick to that choice, yeah. *And maybe I'll stop writing what I think directly from my brain.*

## If you could binge-watch an entire series again for the first time, which one would you choose and why?

I can always enjoy *Malcom in the Middle*, across the ages and the times, it is always fresh for me, and there will forever be different lenses and perspectives to understand the characters and their actions. It's the quintessential family sitcom show, so, I don't really need to watch it for the first time. Actually, every time I watch it, it's like the first time at that moment in my life.

What I wish I could watch for the first time, is probably *Doctor Who*.

*Doctor Who* is a show that I started watching to spend time with my sister back in the day, it made her happy, and it was quite enjoyable as well. At some point in the early seasons I realized, I absolutely loved it.

However, it took some time to get there, I didn't care *that much* about in at first. Sure I paid attention to the story, but I didn't appreciate it for what it was. But when I started to think *"hold up, this is really good"*, I also didn't want to bother beginning from the start. So I just kept going, and really enjoying all of it, even some of the bad parts of the 12th Doctor, until it got absolutely ruined by the 13th Doctor's run, killed by terrible writing and directing.

At this point in my life, I think I could go for a rewatch, even though I'll never have a chance to watch it truly blind like bach then.

There is another huge reason I want to check it out again... **I know English now!**

When I started the series somewhere in 2016, I really didn't know enough of the language as I do today, and even if I could follow some YouTube tutorials in English, *I was totally unable to get the accent of the TV Show*, or to listen to multiple voices at once. You may be asking *why is this not a problem with other shows?*

Well, other shows have **great** Latino dubs, *Malcom* has a great dub and a fantastic localization for its humor and dialogues, the same cannot be said for *Doctor Who*. 

In fact, *Doctor Who* does not have a Latino dub, as far as I know, and I think the Castillian Spanish dub is *not great* either, and fails to capture most of the British humor of the series. I will admit though, I only watched like, 3 episodes in with the Spanish dub, and maybe it works for people from Spain, not me though.

So, yeah, *Doctor Who* for the win!

## Name a TV show that changed your perspective on the world or taught you something valuable

*Malcom in the Middle* is a show that is filled to the brim with life lessons, both good and bad examples of how to handle lots of realistic situations, and relatable family issues.

It's a show that has been on air for years in Mexico, because it is so relatable to every single one of us. A middle-class family trying to get by day by day.

Across the multiple episodes, I have learned plenty of things. Here's a short list.

- Don't blame people without evidence
- Stand up for what is right, even if it turns you into an enemy.
- Do not take advantage of those unable to make conscious decisions.
- Don't assume the worst of your children (or of people in general).
- You are not that important for the place you work for.
- Just because you are smart, doesn't mean you're above others.

In a way, they feel kinda "obvious" but at the same time, watching it when you are 9 or 12 years old, can really change you for the better or (admittedly) not great way---it still features plenty of bad kid behavior and such, but hey, *I turned out alright, right?!*

I had some other things to list, I just really enjoy this show, it is the one show I watched with my family every night before sleep, when I was 10, when I was 14, when I was 18, when I was 23---*Not exactly sure about the exact ages but you see my point*. Every time, I will always either laugh out loud, or I will be able to reflect on what's going on, with the parenting style of Louis or Hal, be it good or bad, or the misfits or behavior of the kids, or whatever Francis is up to away from home. I can see what might work if handled a bit differently, it has always been super fun, enjoyable and even thought-provoking.

In a way, I want to write more, because this show deserves the attention, but, maybe that's better left for another blog post.

## Final thoughts

I think I have plenty of other shows I am yet to watch, to be honest. But the answers I gave made sense to me somehow, except for the first one which was a true ramble compared to the rest, but hey, that's really similar to what my head was going through at the time of writing.

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed these answers, I highly recommend giving the mentioned shows a watch! The one show that didn't made it into the answers properly was *Daredevil*, but it's just soo goood, so I wanted to at least say that here. Give that one a go, the original Netflix series is a masterpiece from start to finish!

Until later!
