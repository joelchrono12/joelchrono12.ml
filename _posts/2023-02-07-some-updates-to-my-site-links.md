Every once in a while my website layout or design has to change. This time it was a relatively simple one, but still worth noting.

First of all, I added my own __[blogroll](/blogroll/)__, where I will feature some of my favorite websites and blogs I follow, usually via RSS. A few of them are also doing [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) like me!

I am currently in the process of adding more blogs as I also add them from mentions in sites I follow such as [Ye Olde Blogroll](https://blogroll.org/) and others blogs like [Kev Quirk's](https://kevquirk.com/blogroll/). If you also have a blogroll let me know!

I currently follow around 150 personal websites, and not all of them have been updated. But there is a chance I actually have you there, so if you make some interesting blogposts one of these days, I may end up adding you too! Some have a great archive already though, so it doesn't really matter how active a blog is to me.

Anyways, I also decided to simplify my navigation bar, and move it all to a [More](/more/) button, following a style similar to [Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/more), his site keeps inspiring me everytime, I can't help it. I also stole his [Stats](/stats) page.

In that site I added some other links from my website, and I also decided to mention a few clubs I am a part of as well as sites I find interesting or enjoy, like tilde communities and stuff like that. I will probably update it further in the future.

I really should be doing my homework right now, but instead I spent the evening messing around with Liquid syntax and YAML files, I feel so bad, but it was fun to do.

This is day 34 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
