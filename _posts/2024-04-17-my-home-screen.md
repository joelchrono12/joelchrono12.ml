I did a post about [what's on my phone]({{ site.url }}/blog/what-is-on-my-phone-fall-2023/) late last year, but I felt like sharing my current homescreen setup too, this was inspired by [@brendon](https://idlethumbs.social/@brendon)'s [homescreen post](https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-home-screen-april-2024). 

Although I've shared some screenshots before, I've never really done full showcase of the whole thing with my gestures and shortcuts. So here it is!

## The screens 

{% include img.html image='/assets/img/blogs/2024-04-17-home-screen.png' caption='My lockscreen and my homescreen side by side' %}

The lockscreen doesn't have anything special, but it's there.

My current homescreen is quite simple. My setup is a single screen with a 12 by 7 grid, with a total of 15 app icons for quick access. I have the default clock widget on top that also shows the date and upcoming alarm. I also disabled the dock---I don't have any use for it.

The icons I use are from [Arcticons](https://arcticons.onnno.nl/), a free and open source icon pack that I have contributed to for a few years already.

## The apps

Anyway the apps I have on my homescreen are sorted in 5 columns with 3 rows each. Every column has a certain type of apps in it.

My most important apps are the ones closer to my right thumb, which are my default Phone app, [Mihon](https://mihon.app) for manga reading---an alternative to Tachiyomi that is the reader alone a integrated way to get the plugins to access manga from websites---and [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org) for Podcasts.

Making use of Nova Launcher's shortcut gestures, some apps have an extra app I can access by swiping the icon up and down. Swiping down on Mihon will open [Librera Reader](http://librera.mobi/), my book reader of choice, whenever I don't use my Kobo. Swiping down on AntennaPod will open YT Music, and up will open [Gramophone](https://github.com/AkaneTan/Gramophone)---or whatever local music player I use, I switch often.

Next column contains my communication apps. My big three are [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app), which has a swipe down gesture for [Proton Mail](https://proton.me), [Discord](https://discord.com/app) that has gestures for [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) and [Element](https://element.io); and [Signal](https://signal.org), with gestures for [Threema](https://threema.ch) and [Conversations](https://conversations.im)

My third column has apps that entertain me, which includes [Tusky](https://tusky.app) for mastodon and fediverse accounts (also a gesture for [Bluesky](https://bsky.app)), then [Brawl Stars](https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/) because I play it a bit. [Cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite) is there too (with a gesture for [Firefox](https://firefox.com) as well).

Next is my media column, which has [Fossify Gallery](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery), [Binary Eye](https://github.com/markusfisch/BinaryEye), to scan barcodes (for work) and [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2) for file management, that is one of the few apps I paid for---back when I didn't have a job for stuff like that---and has been worth every penny.

Finally, the last column has whatever other apps I use sometimes, which is [KeepassDX](https://www.keepassdx.com/) (with a gesture for [Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/)), [FeedMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seazon.feedme), my feed reader of choice for Android since it integrates with my FreshRSS server, and [Droid-ify](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client) (with a gesture for the regular Play Store).

All in all, I have access to __a ton__ of apps with *just* 15 icons in my homescreen.

## Final thoughts

You may notice the abscence of WhatsApp and YouTube, which some of my regular readers might expect since they show in [my usage stats every month]({{ site.url }}/more/tags/monthly). I actually have a gesture for them rather than an icon, so swiping up and down with two fingers will open one app or the other!

So, yeah, now you have seen through me. These are the icons and apps I use in my setup, quite a lot of stuff packed together, but the result is rather minimal I think.
