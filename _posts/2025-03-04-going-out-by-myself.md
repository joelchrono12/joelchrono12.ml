I don't really go out, I prefer to stay at home, and when I do go out by myself, it's to work, sometimes a friend's house, or a shop, or the doctor. I guess the only other activity I do outside is going to the gym! And while I've been enjoying it, it's still more of a task or a habit rather than being out there, you know what I mean.

Going out for fun is something I only really do with my family nowadays, we walk at a mall or go to the movies or a park---typical wholesome family bonding time.

I think I was listening to an episode of *Into the Aether*---will there ever be a week where they're not mentioned at this point?--- where one of the hosts talked about going out to a coffee shop and gaming on their handheld with nothing else to worry or care about, and I thought that doing something like that would be pretty cool.

But then again, why not do it at home? I'm not sure, I guess a change of scenery would not hurt, in fact, there are many times where my parents would be like "stop playing videogames and go do something productive!"---going outside to play videogames is still not productive, but at least they wouldn't be there to tell me. ðŸ¤ª

Maybe I could go to the library, bring my Kobo and read there instead of my bedroom. There's plenty of options if I were to really look. On my [last weeknotes](/blog/2025-w09) I mentioned I performed card magic again to my friends and it was a fun time, perhaps I could do that too for strangers in the streets. That's just wishful thinking to be honest, although carrying a deck of cards won't hurt.

I won't lie, part of me also wants to meet people that way, get asked "hey, what is that device you are reading with? ðŸ¤”" or "is that a Game Boy Advance SP?!? ðŸ¤¯" and geek out about such things with people in the real world. It's something I've always liked doing even if I am terrible at verbally explaining myself.

In the end, work gets in the way, and I'd rather stay at home or go with family during the weekends. I guess something has to change if I were to try this seriously. Who knows? I'll report back here if something happens. Or let the status quo keep going, which is more plausible, honestly.
