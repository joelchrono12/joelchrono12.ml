Today I was just watching some videos on YouTube and finally felt like I should do something a little more active on my computer, and decided to start typing this on a whim. Might as well share some of the stuff that interested me today!

## Just writing

I am once again not writing that much recently. However, unlike other times, it's not really that I don't have time for it, I guess I just don't feel like posting anything lately.

It's not even that I don't write, I have actually written two drafts that I somehow haven't published, and I have also been writing on paper twice a week or so. For a while my [blogging workflow](/blog/my-static-site-workflow/) was kind of messed up because my script to share my blogposts to Mastodon broke due to a misconfiguration of [toot](https://github.com/ihabunek/toot).

But yeah that's not the true reason. When I have time I game, or read, or listen to podcasts and watch videos, I have time to spare, I guess I just haven't been feeling it, until now.

## Dungeon Crawlers for PSP, GBA or SNES

The thing that spawned this interest was actually [this video](https://youtu.be/rVTVQJ1Iktg) that showcased a LotR game for GBA that played like _Diablo_. I have never played Diablo itself but the isometric view and gameplay looked kind of interesting and I wanted to see if there was more I could play on my PSP or my Anbernic handheld.

Reddit says that games that fit this style would be _Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance_ and _Shining Soul I and II_, for the PSP it seemed like there weren't many "worthy" alternatives other than _Dungeon Explorer_ and the PS1 Eboot of _Diablo_ itself.

## A Widescreen remaster of Avatar: The Last Airbender

This video titled _[The City of Omashu - Remastering Avatar The Last Airbender](https://youtu.be/qYtXzTyKEnU)_ by ChunnyKay is exactly what the title says, this guy went ahead and filled in the left and right sides of the original 4:3 aspect ratio. The final result looks simply incredible and it was an enjoyable watch.

## Readrops 2.0 beta finally out

This release on F-Droid caught me by complete surprise, but [Readrops](https://github.com/readrops/Readrops/releases), my favorite RSS client with FreshRSS support, finally got an update after being silent since 2021. I am supper happy for this, although I had to delete my app data and login again for it to launch.

## Final thoughts

The end is over! Tomorrow I'll be writing my summary, and there's a lot of interesting stuff, so you better be here tomorrow!

This is day 67 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
