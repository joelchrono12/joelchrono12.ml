Well well well, as I actually don't have many ideas for today, somehow, I may as well play by the book and do one of those posts where you say stuff so other people participating in Blaugust 2025 get to know me, and well, the same goes for whoever reads this.

For more, feel free to check my [about](/about) page, I guess, or any of the blogposts with the [personal tag](/more/tags/personal) on this website, I guess that would work too!

Anyway, this one will follow the format of [Alexandra's introductory post](https://wrywriter.ca/posts/an-introductory-post), just sharing some random fun (or maybe not so fun) facts about me. Plenty of other bloggers have done different types of introductions as well though.

I decided to leave the titles of mine a bit open ended, so you can, if you want, try and fill it with your own random facts too.


## FACT 1: I simply cannot...

Stay put.

Or at least, I have a hard time not being in constant motion. Even right now as I thought "what fact should I start with" I was fidgeting with my work id card, throwing it around and doing twirls and flourishes with it, until I started typing and I accidentaly dropped it and caused a bit more noise than I expected...

Really, I still touch the walls as I walk alongside one, and I keep flipping my phone, spinning my keys or glancing at my watch when I have nothing to do.

Ok random extra fact, as I wrote this fact, it felt like a deja vu in progress. That was weird.

## FACT 2: I had an accident where I...

Almost lost a finger!

When I was a kid, I was playing hide and seek with a friend at church. There was this room where I thought my friend was, and the door was locked, the window was one of the vertical tall ones, and it could easily be slid up to open it. I tried to do that, it was locked, I forced it, it broke into big chunks of glass, and I sliced the base joint of my pinky finger. My friend was not even there!

I had stitches for quite a while, and due to fact 1, it was definitely a chore, but I learned to do origami one handed, at least. Thankfully, everything ended up fine in the end.

## FACT 3: My favorite plushie was...

Bear, from *Bear in the Big Blue House*, which was a show I really enjoyed as well as a kiddo. I loved it so much, and I played with it quite a lot. Apparently, my parents had to buy me a new one at some point because of how much I had used the first one. I admit I didn't even notice, or I forgot.[^1]

Eventually, they took it away from me and I was sad for a while, I eventually grew up and accepted it... or did I?

*Looks at prices online*

Yes, I did.

## FACT 4: My favorite videogame is...

Most of my usual readers already it's Chrono Trigger, but for whoever is seeing this blog for the first time, feel free to reach out and talk about anything related to Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Monster Hunter, or JRPGs and Metroidvanias in general!

I still need to write a blogpost about my personal Top 25 Games of all time... soon.

## FACT 5: My favorite food is...

Difficult to choose, but what I say most of the time would be *Tostadas*, specifically Tostadas with beans, cheese, chicken, lettuce and tomato, with a bunch of cream on top!

But I also like *Flautas*, *Tamales*, and *Tacos al Pastor*, and all my Mexican food, except for *Menudo*, no thanks.

## FACT 6: I don't follow them much but..

Sports are fun to play!

I like volleyball, football (not the american one), badminton and ping-pong. I'm not good at basketball (or any of the others, really) but I'll participate if I have to. Sadly, I don't go out of my way to play these often though, but when there's the chance I'll take it.

I do like watching football during the World Cup though, but Mexico never goes beyond group phase nowadays so whatever.

And I have read and enjoyed sports anime like *Hajime No Ippo*, *Haikyuu* and *One Outs*, and read manga like *Blue Lock*, *The Boxer* and *Eyeshield 21*, the latter is as close as I get to american football.

## FACT 7: I have a collection of...

Watches, sure, you probably already know that one if you read me. There's around a dozen of them nowadays, which is kind of crazy. Still, not an expensive collection at all since most of them are Casios well under 40 bucks.

But, I also have a collection of twisting puzzles! or Rubiks cubes, or whatever the general term is when not all of them are cube-shaped... 

Anyway, I have cubes from 2x2 to 6x6, I have a Skewb, a Square One (probably my favorite besides 3x3), a Pyraminx, a Megaminx, and some 3x3 mods like the Mirror, Fisher, and Axis cube. I want to get a Ghost cube at some point.

I guess I also have a collection of Nintendo Switch games, but that's for later...
