Recently I have been thinking about why is it so hard to ask someone for forgiveness when you do something wrong, that pissed someone off, but it's not a big deal.

Like, if you think about it, there is this weird middleground of actions between drawing a stickman in the corner of a sheet of a friend's essay, to breaking somebody's smartphone in anger. 

Both of these actions are wrong, but the severity of the latter, can really upset the victim of such thing, or make them seek revenge against you, and if you did not really meant it, you feel bad, and look for ways to pay for what you did. But on the first example, the action can be ignored after a while, and the problem is fixed pretty quickly, and usually everyone just forgets about it.

I just lived trough one of those moments. I did something wrong. The other person got mad at what my action caused, then we kept driving on silence for the next couple of minutes. 

I got this weird feeling, the urge to ask for forgiveness, but at the same time, I feel like my words would be answered by laughter, or just be ignored since it was not a big deal at all.

Maybe it's just the guilt building up within me. I start to think about every little thing I have done in a similar manner, that seems to have no importance on the grand scheme of things, and yet, I can remember them now. I also can remember some (*but not all*) of those moments people have done things wrong towards me recently, and I nor they said anything. 

So I decided to do it, I could not keep shut, I asked for forgiveness, and guess what? Nobody even remembered what I did, and we all laughed at the idea. 

I am still glad of having done that, I was forgiven, maybe such little things are not that important after all, but if you have that feeling, maybe just getting it out there is the best way to deal with it and let it go.
