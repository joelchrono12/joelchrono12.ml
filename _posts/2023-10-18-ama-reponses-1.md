Alright, here are some answers to your questions. If your question is not here, there were some more answers in [a previous post](/blog/ask-me-anything)

- **[@Doctor_Derp](https://worldkey.io/@Doctor_Derp) asks: Do you like waffles/pancakes/french toast?**

    Yes, I like them all, I eat them all, I enjoy them all, good food.

- **[Konstantin](https://konstantintutsch.de) asks: what's your favorite kind of coffee?**

    I think it would be American coffee? It's just coffee with a couple spoons of sugar and fresh milk. *CafÃ© con leche!*

    I also like *CafÃ© de Olla.*

- **[Clayton](https://claytonerrington.com/) asks: What was your first computer and what lead you to love technology and FOSS?**

    This is a hard one, I remember playing with my father's laptops a few times, there was this cereal box motorcycle racing game that I found quite fun. I think I still have it.

    My first desktop was some sort of HP thing with 512 MB of RAM, running Windows XP and quite a bit of very slow hard drive storage. I remember trying a CD of FIFA 07 for PC and it ran pretty well. I didn't really care about FOSS until 2016 or so, when I discovered F-Droid and custom ROMs, but still, it was more because of the free as in gratis, I didn't care much about the freedom for another couple years when I started to care about game development, discovered Godot, then Linux, and the rest is history. I may go into more detail in a biggee post.

- **[Rogue](https://ww0cj.radio) asks: Any rare games youâ€™ve been wanting to find and play on your PSP?**

    I don't really have anything I can't find ðŸ˜‰ ... But there are some games I've been meaning to play. One of those games is _Riviera: The Promised Land_, it sounds neat, and it is a JRPG, I don't know what else to say.

- **[Hyde](https://lazybear.io) asks: What do you think of those youtubers that do some boxing?**

    I don't know who does that, not really following that side of YouTube, but the few times I've heard about that I found out there's also Chess-Boxing where you do a round of boxing and another of chess, and I think that sounds kind of fun.

- **[Benjamin Hollon](https://benjaminhollon.com) asks: If you could do anything full-time without having to worry about money or other factors, what would that dream job be?**

    Traveling is probably the answerâ€”not really a dream job though.

    Honestly I would probably like to do game development, I really enjoyed it during the pandemic and it was fun, I would use some of my infinite money to get a powerful desktop and some instruments to make my soundtracks and learn more about everything. I liked making games. Maybe even be in charge of just directing it,  having a full team of well paid people to help me achieve my visionâ€”I don't know that vision yet, though.


- **[82Mhz](https://82mhz.net) asks: What brought you to blogging and having a website in the first place?**

    I kind of answered this question already! In [my previous blogpost](/blog/just-start-blogging). In short, I found out about the fediverse, about the small web community and Linux, and I decided to start blogging once I discovered Kev Quirk's [100 Days To Offload challenge](https://100daystooffload.com).

- **[CactoChameleon9](https://masto.doserver.top@daniel) asks: Do you have any interesting short term or long term ambitions?**

    I just want to have a job that allows me to have 2 free days and where I just have to be in front of a computer doing whatever I'm asked to do, I want to have enough time to keep blogging, doing my hobbies and discovering new ones. I would like to code or expand on one of the videogames I've developed, as a solo project of mine, and earn some money that way tooâ€”it would still be FOSS though.

    I would like to have a family, have kids, teach them everything I know as soon as possible, specially origami! They would be bilingual, solve rubiks cubes, do yo-yo tricks and be the coolest kids at school, But I also want to be able to accept their choices in lifeâ€”unless that choice involves not doing origami. ðŸ˜¤

- **[Wouter](https://dosgame.club/@jefklak) asks: Why isn't your top [25 GOAT](https://fosstodon.org/@joel/111139136802999906) list on your blog, and why don't you talk a little bit about each entry?**

    Oh yeah, that was going to be a future blog! I kind of did it on a whim, I will expand on my choices later and think this through more in depth, it should be fun! I meant to do it but I kinda forgot, so thanks to the reminder... *proceeds to forget again.*

For now these are all the answers for the questions I could find, if you have anymore questions feel free to leave them somewhere! This was really fun, actuallyâ€”let's do it again!
