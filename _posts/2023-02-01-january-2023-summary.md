I went for 31 days straight posting semi-decent posts. By checking out my archive you can see how January tends to be the month with the most content published, but 31 days straight is quite a record for me, and with this summary, 32 posts in 32 days will be done. Its kind of awesome to be this consistent. Let's start then.

# Podcasts

I listened to podcasts for 73 hours during this month. I actually decided to listen a few podcasts in Spanish, due to the post I wrote about [most of my media consumption being not in my native language]({{ site.url }}/blog/struggling-to-consume-content-in-spanish/). They still didn't make it to the top of my stats this month, but still, nice progress.


- __Dungeons and Daddies__ (Season 2): I listened to the first 5 episodes of season 2 of this show. Pretty good so far.
- __Into The Aether__: I listened to 5.5 hours of this one. I actually haven't started their GOTY episode, which is always like 5 hours long by itself, so maybe this month they will stay at the top just because of it.
- __Se√±ales__: This one's in Spanish! Its about mystery and stuff, kinda like Unexplained which I've mentioned before.
- __Modo 7__: This one is a gaming podcast in Spanish too, I actually really liked it, listened to episode 35 about Resident Evil and to an episode about the physical vs digital ownership of games.
- __Trash Taste__: The latest couple of episodes are absolute gems, they did an episode generated by AI and its some of the funniest ones I've ever listened to. The one before that one was also awesome!

Other podcasts I listened to were:
- Revolutions
- Darknet Diaries
- Retro Game Time Machine
- Late Night Linux

# Movies and Series

- __The Beast with a Million Eyes__: A [thread by Kevin Bowen](https://fosstodon.org/@kevinbowen/109770942541409186) on Fosstodon got me interested on watching some old films. One of the ones in that list was this one. It was a pretty bad one, I watched it in two sittings right before going to sleep. I kinda enjoyed it, not gonna lie, as cheesy and low budget as it is. The title and poster are lying, so have low expectations.

# Books

- __1984 by George Orwell__: I finished it, as promised, I can't believe I had stopped reading it a few years ago when I gave it a try for the first time, right before the good stuff started! The last third of this book is a gem, I couldn't stop reading and that ending is so real. A must read, honestly.
- __I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream by Harlan Ellison__: I can't believe I didn't finish this one yet. A collection of short stories that are all great, they are kind of sci-fi but the author doesn't like to categorize his works. Regardless, the ones I've read have all been really good, short and sweet.



# Anime
- __Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood__: I finished it, and I really loved it. I get why its considered the best among them all. Awesome action, amazing characters and a beautifully scripted story. I think I will watch some more content of this soon enough.
- __Princess Mononoke__: I have wanted to watch Studio Ghibli movies for a while, but I've been meaning to watch it with my family or friends. That finally came true this month when we watched this movie, I really, really enjoyed it a lot.
- __Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2__: Yeah the way the later seasons are organized kind of sucks. But I watched 4 episodes of this one and it is quite great. I had read the manga up to 10 or so chapters before the ending, so I know most of what's happening here. Great stuff, I still miss the old animation style.
- __My Dress Up Darling__: For some reason I hadn't watched the last episode of the first season of this anime, I did it at the beginning of the month, it was alright.

# Manga

I actually barely read anything. This time, I only read some chapters of series I've mentioned before:

- Sakamoto Days
- One Punch Man
- Komi Can't Communicate
- Kingdom

# Device usage

This month was a little weird, going back to school only a couple days a week, and an update to one of my favorite games really changed the way I usually use my devices this time.

## Phone usage

Used for a total of 204 hours. A bit less than December!

- Newpipe for 41 hours
- Brawl Stars for 27 hours
- Tusky for 24 hours
- WhatsApp for 12 hours
- Librera Reader for 8 hours
- Bromite for 6 hours
- Tachiyomi for 5 hours

## Desktop usage

- Firefox for 120 hours
- Alacritty for 38 hours
- GNU Octave for 3 hours
- MPV for 3 hours
- Minecraft for 2.5 hours


# Wrapping up

Not a lot to say, this is the first post of February, tomorrow I am travelling, so it is likely that tomorrow I will break my streak, but I still have hope that it won't be the case.

This is day 32 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
