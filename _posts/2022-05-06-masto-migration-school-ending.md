I have been on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org) for a while, and its the best place to hang out for me, but I was given the chance to help manage a new small community known as [Benign.Town](https://benign.town), I even designed the logo for it, which is kinda cool. I decided to do this since I wanted to learn a bit more about how this all works, and it was an opportunity I could not ignore, since I would like to do my own in the future, at least for personal use.

Because of this, I will place a redirect on my Fosstodon account to my new one, which is at [@joel@benign.town](https://benign.town/@joel), I will not migrate all of my followers, I did not feel like doing so, just in case.

Funnily enough, I realized that my University blocks the domain name, I have no idea why, but I can't access it there. Honestly, it's not the end of the world, since I shouldn't use social media when I'm supposed to be learning. 

In other news, I just realized that my semester is ending a lot sooner than I expected, but I still have hope that I'll be able to finish all of my homework and final projects. I have to be honest, I am pretty far behind in a couple of assignments that had no set due date, and a fair amount of those have accumulated. I need to get going and finish all of them, pretty much in less than two weeks.

This will be my last post in Fosstodon for the time being, so if you would like to keep following me make sure to go to my [current account](https://benign.town/@joel).

Also I kinda wanted to add some pictures to my feed, I know its bloated, but its my bloat. Time is running out.
