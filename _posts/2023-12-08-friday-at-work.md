I have been at my job for a couple weeks now, and I have to say, I don’t dislike it at all, I kind of enjoy learning so many things at the moment, but it is also a bit of a daunting task. I basically handle a bunch of different databases in multiple formats. Those databases are in charge of users, workers, groups, machinery and many other things, and I have to help maintain them and modify them when needed.

I would not say that I love what I do, but it’s not bad at all, and the best thing is that Fridays seems to be pretty free. I mostly do support for the different areas I just mentioned, which means that as long as everything is running smoothly, I get to sit down and type away whatever I want, just like now.

Sadly (and thankfully), work devices are pretty well locked down, I am not allowed to plug-in USB drives and I can’t login to personal accounts of social media and such. At the very least I haven’t seen anyone else doing it, so I assume browser history and usage is recorded by the IT and Security department.

While watching some online courses that I needed to take, I actually realized that the company has some pretty good security practices. It is almost annoying to me, because I want to peek behind the curtains but I also don’t want to lose my job. I have a feeling it doesn’t really matter that much, but I am still curious.

Speaking of security, one of the jobs I started to wonder about is Pen Testing. The Darknet Diaries podcast has been quite a source of entertainment about those stories from people getting into banks and random nameless companies. Despite what the courses say, there are many things my workmates don’t really use at all. From using a password manager, to locking their laptops when away.

For example. Right now I still don’t have an access card for the office I work on, I have to wait for my workmate to get in, but sometimes people will just open the door for me and I’m astonished at the potential damage this act of courtesy might trigger. As long as you look like someone who is supposed to be there, people will assume that’s the case. 

Anyway, while my computer is quite locked down and I do apply basic InfoSec stuff, there’s nothing in my personal phone to impede me from doing whatever I want; as long as I don’t have work matters to attend to, of course. I’ve been a bit abusive of this lack of responsibilities and read quite a bunch of manga and also a book. I am currently reading Ender’s Game, I somehow could not stop myself once I started, I am still early in the story, only on chapter 5, but I love the fact that I don’t know what’s even going on just yet. There’s a war, there are buggers, weird chips monitoring kids and there’s Ender who adults expect to be humanity’s savior. I will write a review once I finish it, hopefully before the year ends.

I still have to write 15 more posts before the end of the year, in order to complete the challenge! If I keep writing during work hours I might finish this very soon, but I don't really feel like doing that, still have a lot to learn despite it all...

For now, this is day 85 of [100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com). See you later!
