Now that I am done with *#100DaysToOffload*, I was a little confused as to what to write about, now that I don't have a reason to write something quick and constantly, I have felt a bit more inspired to do a different kind of writing. Nothing too serious, but maybe more personal and planned. 

Not once during the previous year did I wrote something that took me more than a day to publish. There were no drafts, no evolution, I just typed what was on my mind and focused on having a decent amount of words. I did not explain things in depth, I did not use perfect grammar, I just wrote, and honestly, I will still do that to a certain degree.

However, I feel like I should add more substance to each post. Another thing I wanted to have is focusing on a certain topic during multiple blogs. Something like what [Benjamin Hollon](https://fosstodon.org/@benjaminhollon) is doing with his [Digital Citizenship](https://seewitheyesclosed.com/articles/series/digital-citizenship/) series, right now some of my ideas would be "videgames that actually changed my life", "hobbies I got into and why", and revisit [other ideas I wanted to expand](/blog/too-much-yet-nothing-to-say/) such as game development, more android shenanigans, and things.

At the same time I would also like to create simpler posts such as Hund's [monthly links](https://hund.tty1.se/weblog/categories/#monthly%20links), as well as monthly reviews of my media consumption, app usage, habits and such.

I wanna do some cleanup too, right now I have [tags](/tags) that I assign to each post I write for this blog, but I want to get rid of a few that are kind of repetitive, I still have to think of a way to organize everything and try to find a way to automate it somewhat, since I don't want to have to change every single post just to delete a tag. Or maybe I just leave it as it is, whatever.

Also, I have to work on a new way to finish each writing, I am not bad at concluding things, *at least when it comes to school projects*, but I got pretty used to just going with "This is day X of *#100DaysToOffload*" whenever I felt like I had nothing else to add. Speaking of which, I will not do another round this year, because ending in February feels kinda *meh*, I'll just post normal blogs until next year arrives and then I'll consider giving it another chance!

So, that's it for the moment, I hope you read me later!
