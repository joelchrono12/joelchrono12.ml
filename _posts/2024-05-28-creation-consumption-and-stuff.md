One of the latest posts by Manuel Moreale is  [Consumption to Creation Ratio](https://manuelmoreale.com/consumption-to-creation-ratio), which was shared by some friends on my timeline and praised quite a bit, so I decided to read it, and I gotta say, I recommend it too!

However, something made me feel a bit icky about it, not the writing itself or the idea behind it, but a word that to me, is almost uncofortable for some reason.

Consumption.

In this specific context, I feel like this word is almost a swear word to me, I don't like it, I don't want to say I "consume" content. In fact, I don't like referring to the "content" as such either to be honest.

Don't get me wrong, there are definitely times when I "consume", whenever I scroll on social media, and read a few words in a random post, or whenever I watch a YouTube Short of a topic I don't care about just because it is mildly interesting to me, knowing very well it's not worth it, and forgetting about it after scrolling down.

However, more than just consumption. I think being mindful of whatever I'm watching, reading, playing or enjoying, should be called something more than just "consuming". 

I think the best word for it would be __nourishing__.

Consuming to me, is like eating, maybe it's not junk food or desserts, but you are just doing it because you need to. But nourishing rings a little different in my head, it means something that helps you get nutrients, keeps you healthy, and helps you grow, it is more purposeful and leads you to be a better person and improve your state of mind.

So now I wonder, what would be the ratio, between what I consume, what I nourish, and what I create? To be continued... maybe?
