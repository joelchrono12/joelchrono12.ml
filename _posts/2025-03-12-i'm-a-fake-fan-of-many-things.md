I don't like to call myself a poser, but there are things that I will really like and defend for no reason, or that just amuse me even if I've never had any real experience with it, being videogames, movies or some other hobby. However, I just keep watching random content about it on the internet, like reviews, people talking about it or performing it.

At first, this was going to just be a list of those things just for fun, but I ended up writing some overall thoughts about what being a "fake fan" even means at all later in the post. For now, the list!

## Resident Evil

All in all I've only played like 3 hours total of any Resident Evil game at all, I have also watched a full playthrough of Resident Evil VIII and as a totally real gamer fan, I understood the references and how it's a *return to form* for the franchise in the best of ways.

Seriously, I don't really know what gets me to want to love this series and want to be a part of it, especially the original trilogy, the tank controls, the fixed camera angles, everything simply looks so aesthetic and the vibes of this franchise are so unique.

One of these days I'll finally start Resident Evil 2 on my retro handheld and call it a day.

Also the movies? Haven't watched any from beginning to end, yet they show up in my mind from time to time and I watch some random scene on YouTube for no reason.

## Dragon Ball

Dragon Ball is simply a cultural phenomenon in Mexico, we absolutely love it, it's like a second religion. It's honestly quite impressive. However, I was really never into it myself, my parents didn't let me watch it, and I never really felt like watching it.

I did play some of the Budokai videogames for the PSP, and I'm tempted all the time to get Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot on my Switch, still hasn't happened though.

All in all, I have been surrounded by Dragon Ball merchandise all my life and most people around me loves it, and honestly, I just love being a part of that even if I haven't really gotten into it myself. I will definitely start the manga one day to stop being a fake fan.

## Skating

When I was a young boy, my cousin gave me to choose between a scooter, and a skateboard, I chose wrong. My scooter's wheel was too used up and ended up breaking, and my parents told me to sell it for a few pesos to the truck buying *fierro viejo*. Regardless, my first chance to get into skating, or at least scooting, down the drain.[^1]

When I was still a young boy, I was gifted a Game Boy Advance SP by a friend, I was happy. The only game he gave me with it was Tony Hawk Underground 2---considered the worst looking one of the GBA ports. Whatever, comparison is the thief of joy, it was all I had and played for a while and it rocked.

Those two things are the closest I ever got to skating, besides watching a lot of skating videos and tutorials, never getting into it properly, I think I'm too old for it now...

## Warhammer 40,000

A year or so ago, I really got into Warhammer 40K, I watched people play it on YouTube, I watched a lot of lore videos as well, for multiple hours, I even watched a couple of books in that universe.

I watched videos about the best sets to get started with my army, people painting their minifigures and doing all other kinds of stuff.

I still find myself entertained by a lot of that today, but I haven't really, really gotten into it, other than those couple books I read. I do plan to keep on reading the Eisenhorn series one of these days, but not much more than that

## Just enjoy things however you want

I think that I could have listed a couple of extra things, but the more I wrote, the more I realized that it's all just a matter of perspective, I could be a fake fan of literally every single thing I do, at least from the point of view of some die-hard followers of X or Y franchise or hobby.

You see, even in my most beloved hobby, origami, I could be not worthy of being a true fan, why? Well I have never bought proper origami paper---although a dear friend gifted me some sheets a while back---and I have never bought proper origami books!

The same could be true with Casio watches, I guess? I only have like 6 of them, and convinced plenty of people of getting one, but is that enough to prove I'm a fan?

Initially I really felt like I was a "fake fan" of the things I listed, and I sure wish I could just put a bit more effort towards getting into them, but I have to accept that I will not be able to get into everything I want---even if it seems like I get into something new every day sometimes.

The point is, I can still appreciate stuff without being an expert at anything. So I guess that the question now is, what does it take to be a true fan? To not have a life outside that niche, I guess?

I'll just do what I like, when I can and, whatever, this post is such a mess, I don't know what kind of conclusion to make anymore.

This is day 36 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)

[^1]: So I'm actually rather angry remembering that this happened, I can't believe that my parents made me sell my scooter for barely enough money to buy a Coca Cola. Like, they could have bought me new wheels or something, but I guess skating shops were a rather weird concept for us, I don't think it was a cheap scooter either, there were probably plenty of wheels sizes and such, regardless, the past is in the past. ðŸ˜­
