So for this new semester I have some pretty decent teachers this time around. There is nobody where I feel like they are just wasting my time or the don't really want to be there. They all seem pretty knowledgeable and willing to help out at any moment if possible. I still have a couple who are kinda boring to listen to, at least for me, but I can still learn somewhat nonetheless

For some reason however, most of my current teachers want me to write stuff down in paper, and I guess I know the reason why. There is a lot of copying and fraud for most homework here, I admit to have done it myself so the point is that even if you are copying you are at least writing it down and having to read the words at least once. I guess its the only possible solution to a very common problem here, and I guess the rest of the world.

Personally, I don't like it, I am not a copy-paste kinda guy, even if my work is based on someone else's I will write it down word by word, changing the order of phrases, fixing gramar mistakes, or even correcting or reordering the steps from some mathematical equation. And, being honest to myself, if I am in a rush, I am not paying attention or learning anything either way since I am just racing against the clock to deliver whatever work I had to do for the day.

We are going back to the classrooms next week. Me and my classmates will finally meet again and maybe the routine will have to change. Despite my complains here, I won't really be able to write most of my classes in my computer anymore since the chairs and tables aren't design to hold a laptop, and I will probably get in trouble since they might think I am getting distracted or something.

I guess I have to accept it, I will have to write things down on paper again, who knows, maybe I will end up loving it or having some sort of realization or eve-opening experience that makes me realize I actually do better by using the old ways of learning and taking notes.

Its been a while, I've gained some weight, my laptop is not in great shape either, I guess I'll have to adjust. Or maybe, probably, we'll stay again inside home due to the rise of Omicron over my country and hospitals being full again while people care less and less about the whole thing.

Whatever the case, for now, I don't like writing on paper, and I don't want to go back to classrooms during these times yet, but whatever happens, I'll have to deal with it.
