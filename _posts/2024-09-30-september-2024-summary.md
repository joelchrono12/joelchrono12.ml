This month was quite crazy, and I did a lot of things this time around. It was a rather strange month, where anime and manga were kings, and reading is rising up again from the ashes.

## Podcasts

I only listened to 69 hours of podcasts this month, compared to 96 in august, quite the opposite huh.

- **NPC: Next Portable Console** is a rather new podcast that talks about the world of portable gaming devices, from the cheap retro handhelds by Anbernic and Miyoo, to official ones like the PSVita, portable mods tabletop consoles and high end stuff like the Steam Deck or Ayaneo lineup, also accesories and related news in this small world. I've listened to every single episode so far.
- **Retro Game Time Machine** has been back at it for me, with episodes on Minecraft, Bayonetta, Mirror's Edge and others, I was quite hooked this month.
- **Welcome to Night Vale** was my usual bedtime listening show, I actually got quite hooked on a recent arc, so I re-listened to some older episodes instead and will go back where I left off when I'm awake.
- **Stuff You Should Know** made some interesting episodes on glasses, the 1904 Olympic Marathon and Internet Mysteries!
- Vergecast, Late Night Linux and Into The Aether were of course part of my listening cycle.

## Anime & Shows

- **JuJutsu Kaisen Season 1 & 2** were introduced to me by my sister. I wasn't really that much into it at first, but it quickly got really, really good, and we basically binged the whole thing in a week.
- **Dungeon Meshi** was started only a few hours ago, still during September, and we watched the first 4 episodes, it was quite an interesting premise with charming characters, so we will probably keep watching it and finish it during October.

## Movies

- **JuJutsu Kaisen 0** was a requisite before going into season 2, and boy am I happy to have seen it, it is a prequel to everything going on during the anime show, but the backstory is quite awesome! Great action sequences and fun anime moments, and an epic setup for things to come in the series.
- **Officer Black Belt** is a korean action film about a martial artist who fights against predators and abusers, becoming a martial arts officer. The film tackes some serious issues, and it's one you can't judge by its horrible cover on Netflix, it has a weird tone and comedy sometimes, but the action is genuinely great and kept me etertained for a bit.

## Books

Behold, books are upon us.

- **Hothouse** was finally finished by me, after like a month of hiatus due to gaming and manga and stuff. Anyway, I was really amazed by this book, everytime I picked it up I was inmersed by its world and environments, I highly recommend it.

- **Leviathan Wakes** is the first book in the Expanse series, and I'm currently in the process of reading it! I am in a small book club now and I'm flying through its pages like nothing else before, having to commit with other people helps a lot too, and it's nice to talk about what's going on. The book follows multiple plot lines masterfully, and has quite a great world I'm very invested in very much.

## Manga

- **JuJutsu Kaisen** was something I started as soon as I finished season 2, I actually went back to the beginning again, and it is really cool to see how those pages were brought to life in the show. I am enjoying the art and the panelling quite a bit on this one.
- **JuJutsu Kaisen 0** is actually the oneshot that started it all. I think the movie is much better, but it's nice to see the early design of some of the characters, very cool stuff.
- **DanDaDan** is so so close to finally get its anime released, so I'm doing my best to catch up with it, if only JJK hadn't shown up, I am only 20 or so chapters behind, so that's good!

## Gaming

I bought quite a lot of games last month for my Switch, but I've only really played the following:

- **Faster Than Light** is something I didn't expect to like as much, but it did, and now I've played it for like 11 hours in 2 days, it is a great game with simple mechanics that are hard to master. I am really having a fun time with it and probably will for a while longer.
- **Monster Hunter Rise** saw a lot of action this month, I have done quite a bit of high rank quests, but I didn't play as often as before this month. Still a fair bit though.

## Device Usage

### Laptop

I used my computer for around 40 hours

- Firefox for 15 hours
- Faster Than Light for 11 hours
- Alacritty for 5 hours
- Inkscape for 4 hours


### Phone

I used my phone for 185 hours

- YouTube for 48 hours
- WhatsApp for 26 hours
- Tusky for 17 hours
- Signal for 14 hours
- Discord for 12 hours
- Mihon for 10 hours
- Firefox for 9 hours

### E-Reader 

I finally had enough usage time for my Kobo to be worth sharing.

During **September**, I read for a total of 11:20 hours, 737 pages:
- **Leviathan Wakes** for 5:48 hours, 330 pages
- **Hothouse** for 5:07 hours, 384 pages

## Finishing thoughts

I am happy to finally be reading more lately, it is always nice to see progress being made on that part, but I have also enjoyed a lot of the gaming and the anime I've watched, so it is cool to be able to do all that. Podcasting + Faster Than Light will probably be a killer combo during October, so we'll see!
