Hey! What's on my phone videos are the kind of thing I am always looking for on YouTube. I miss the times when Youtubers like Marques Brownlee would do videos talking about the apps they used, I enjoyed them quite a bit, although they got kinda repetitive. But I still decided to do my own blogpost about it.

Interestingly enough, most of the people doing these videos are female iPhone or Samsung owners who are usually kpop fans, they use tons of social media apps, camera filters, video editors. They'll even mention the case they're using, the stickers or pictures of their favorite idol they have on them and stuff like that which I honestly don't care about. There's nothing bad about any of this, it's simply not interesting to me anymore.


Whatever, some of these already are in my [uses](/uses) page but others are not as important, but may be interesting to you. I'll try to categorize the apps, but let's start from the top.

* alright
{:toc}

# Android ROM

I am currently using [ArrowOS](https://arrowos.net/) since its one of not so few official ROMs still supporting my device. It is a great rom with quite a lean set of features, more focused on performance than customization.

# The apps

Most of my apps are indeed FOSS, but I still have some proprietary apps, I'll make some keys to mark them a bit more, and also split them in categories. I am completely copying this from [Dom Corriveau's blogpost](https://blog.ctms.me/posts/2023-09-16-what-is-on-my-phone/), which happened to have some great ideas when it comes to organizing this huge list, so there we go.

**Categories**
- 🐧 = Availabe on F-Droid
- 🔗 = Available on GitHub or website
- 🤖 = Only on Google Play
- 📱 = Stock app that comes with the device

## Everyday Use

- 🐧 Aegis Authenticator: 2FA manager with a nice interface and easy to backup.
- 🐧 AntennaPod: Podcast app, keeps stats and its FOSS so I like it.
- 🐧 Daily You: Take a picture per day and track how you feel, I didn't think this would stick but I've been going for a week!
- 🐧 K-9 Mail: E-mail client with constant updates, encryption, and everything I need.
- 🐧 KeepassDX: Password manager.
- 🐧 MJ-PDF: A pretty lightweight pdf reader that just works.
- 🐧 Readrops: My FreshRSS client of choice, I also like FeedMe
- 🐧 Signal: I really love chatting with the 3 contacts I have who use this.
- 🐧 Solid Explorer: A fantastic file manager, what I like is that it shows folder storage size and has some other nice features.
- 🐧 Tachiyomi: Best manga app, supports many sources and has tons of features and progress tracking support.
- 🐧 Tusky: A Mastodon client that has been around forever.
- 🐧 Vivaldi: My current browser, snappy and fast, but Chromium based.
- 🤖 Facebook Lite: All of Mexico uses this, sadly.
- 🤖 Spotify: I listen to music here, it is how it is, *for now...*
- 🤖 WhatsApp: All of Mexico uses this, sadly.

## App Stores
- 🐧 Droid-ify: A modern and secure F-Droid client.
- 🐧 Obtainium: Fetch updates for apps available from any git repo and other sources.
- 🐧 FF Updater: Get updates for Firefox and other browsers, I get Vivaldi from here. Could probably just use Aurora Store.
- 🐧 Aurora Store: Alternative to the Play Store, it can even download the apps you paid for.

## Entertainment

Social media, videos and stuff that entertains me, and sometimes annoys me.

- 🐧 Eternity for Lemmy: A fork of Infinity that uses its interface but has Lemmy as a backend
- 🐧 Librera Reader: Reading books is something I don't do as often nowadays, but this reader is great.
- 🐧 Newpipe + Sponsorblock: A Youtube frontend alternative with a lighter interface and intergration with Sponsorblock.
- 🔗 Aniyomi: Anime is fun, but I don't watch it as often as I read manga.
- 🤖 Bluesky: I use this from time to time, mostly to keep getting invite codes and giving them away to people on Mastodon.
- 🤖 Mercado Libre: Basically latino Amazon with better interface, I like to scroll and see stuff I could buy.
- 🤖 Threads: This has stayed on my phone somehow. It is kinda fun to scroll now that the Following tab exists.

## Comms

The services I use to communicate with friends, family, work and internet strangers.

- 🐧 Threema Libre: I really love talking to the three wonderful people I know who use this messaging app.
- 🐧 Telegram FOSS: There are too many cool groups on Telegram, I also have like 3 people I haven't really talked to in a while there.
- 🤖 Discord: The communities here are also quite good, but I need to do some spring cleaning, too many servers.
- 🐧 Mattermost: The app is still in Beta, I use it to access Fosstodon's patreon and moderation chat rooms.
- 🐧 Monocles Chat: The XMPP client I use nowadays, yet another fork of Conversations.
- 🐧 Proton Mail: I still have Proton Mail for some use cases.

- 🐧 Nextcloud: A nice client that auto uploads pictures from my Camera folder to my Nextcloud and other things.
- 🐧 PlainApp: This is a fantastic program to access my phone data, contacts, media and anything you want by turning the phone into a simple web server, it comes with a great interface and TONS of features. It's also an RSS reader, a ChatGPT client, phone screen mirroring and many other things.
- 🐧 DAVx5: This lets me sync my calendars and contacts from my Nextcloud server to my phone
- 🐧 OpenKeyChain: PGP support on my phone, I use it with K-9 Mail to encrypt emails to people.

## Root

These apps need root access to work.

# Finishing thoughts

Alright I think this is pretty much it. I skipped some things like banking apps and such because nobody cares.
