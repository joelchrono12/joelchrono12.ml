description: Getting games on my switch gives me a great way to play them everywhere however I want, but being unable to just put the games I already own on it is frustrating me a lot.

When this year started I had never spent more than 100 bucks total on games of any kind.

If I recall correctly I bought a couple games on my phone, maybe a season pass once. And a couple years ago I bought Cross Code, Axiom Verge and Hollow Knight. I still don't finish any of the games I've bought somehow, adult life is a sad little thing.

Of course, I also have an Epic Games account with a bunch of games, such as Celeste, The Batman trilogy, the Tomb Raider Trilogy, the Bioshock trilogy, and tons of other games I've acquired over the years for free. I don't think I actually own any of the games in there but I can play them at least.

Whatever, since I got my Switch, I discovered and rediscovered a bunch of games that I want. But I also found myself wishing to just, play the games I *already own* on my Switch.

Seriously, I wanna play Hollow Knight, I paid the price on Steam, why can't I have it on my Switch? Why does the world have to be like this??

At the very least, why can't I drag and drop (or `cp`) my savedata from my computer to my Switch's filesystem?

Paying the same thing multiple times just because is so annoying. Sure if it takes some effort to port a game ask for payment, but if your engine can just export to whatever format you want, why.

Don't get me wrong, there are many games that offer a DRM free copy for itâ€”some even add a Steam keyâ€”for just a few bucks. But that doesn't solve the issue of running them on my Switch, or any other console.

I am probably just going to buy the games I want againâ€”and not complete them for another year maybeâ€” but I'll be very upset about it. ðŸ˜¤

I am really considering to just get my OLED model chipped and call it a day, get whatever I desire on it, it would be so liberating and fun.

Maybe I'll get a Steam Deck...
