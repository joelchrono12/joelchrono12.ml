June has been one of the craziest months of the year so far. I've managed to do quite a bit of stuff so far, so yeah, let's get started!

## Podcasts

- __Stuff You Should Know__: I listened to a TON of episodes, literally like 12 episodes that came out this month. This is such an interesting Podcast and the host are really nice, I can sleep to it, or just have it in the background. I wish they had a Patreon or something without ads because that's the only annoyance here.
- __Dungeons and Daddies__: The 3rd season of the show just began and it is going great so far, it is a completely different adventure very separate from the previous two seasons, and that's great. I am liking it quite a bit.
- __Relatos de la Noche__: This is a horror podcast in Spanish, but there's actually an English version now with the same host! It's called Tales of the Night, give it a listen! It's pretty good.
- __Into The Aether__: The main hosts of the show went on vacation for a bit, returned for the Nintendo Direct and then vanished for another bit, but the special episodes with guests have been awesome.
- __Trash Taste__: Back again with the boys, their episode on the most popular games of all time was unhinged.

## Manga

- __Monster__: Masterpiece, I completed this and it was fantastic, the intrigue, the mystery, the climax. This is something you should give a read to, or watch the anime! Even if you hate anime or manga and their tropes, you should give this a go. Completely unique psychological thriller, it's really worth it.
- __Dandadan__: With the upcoming anime of this manga where both the paranormal and alien invasions exist, I decided to keep reading this and yes, it keeps getting crazy, the panelling and the action here is great fun, and the story just keeps getting weirder and crazier but in a fun way. This is the total opposite of Monster, but it's still good.
- __Blue Lock__: I went back to this sports manga and it is just, unhinged. Crazy moments and panels just keep coming and the stakes get higher, everything for the sake of scoring a goal! Honestly kind of ridiculous moments but the hype is still real despite it all.


## Anime

- __Frieren: Beyond Journey's End:__ The first season of this anime was finished by me and my sister. This is one of the most beautiful pieces of media I've seen in a while. This is a fantasy anime that gracefully deals with the common tropes that plague the genre. It is a wonderful story with amazing animation and incredible tought provoking moments. If you are confortable with silence, and contemplating the beauty of your existence, give this a go.

- __Mob Psycho 100__: I introduced my sister to this anime and it still rocks.

## Movies & Shows

- __Inside Out 2__: The sequel is here, and it didn't disappoint at all! I quite liked this movie, it is not as tight as the first one, despite the short runtime, but it's still a fun time.

- __The Acolyte__: The new Star Wars show in the block. Not as bad as I've heard but not as good as some say, I think. The directing is weird, the cuts are strange, but the intrigue is there and the plot is kinda moving, so far I've watched 4 episodes and I plan to keep going, so yeah, good enough so far.

## Games

Here's where the fun begins once again! Since I got a Miyoo Mini Plus I have kept playing a lot of stuff.

- __Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga__: I finished this game after actual years of starting and leaving over and over again. I am so glad I finally started this and got it done, it was a great game and a fantastic entry to the RPG genre.
- __Metroid Zero Mission__: I got this done in a bit over 4 hours and it was great, this is not the first time I complete it but it felt great to know my way around it and just know how to move and stuff. Despite it, I still forgot some things and figuring my way around things was awesome as well.
- __Kirby's Dream Land__: This was a short game, the first Kirby game ever, and it definitely has all of what would turn the franchise into the success it is. It's short and sweet, worth a playthrough!
- __Final Fantasy VII__: I managed to move my save file from my PSP to my Miyoo Mini Plus, and it has been a fantastic way to return to it. I am finally making progress again, and it's awesome! I just got out of Rocket Town and just exploring around.
- __Pokemon Unbound__: After getting the Anbernic RG35XX SP, I decided to also try playing Pokemon once again! It's been quite fun, and it's a great game for the bus rides. The clamshell form factor is truly nostalgic for me.
