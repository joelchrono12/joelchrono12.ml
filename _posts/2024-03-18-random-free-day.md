This day was a free day, I didn't go to work, and I had no responsibilities, other than some stuff outside my control.

I woke up, and I was like "it's been a while since I watched some anime", I ended up binging through the whole of *Uncle From Another World*, just a bit of a slice of life comedy with some Isekai elements that I found quite hilarous, if a little too suggestive for my taste at times, I just couldn't stop from laughing at how ridiculous it is. It has some great comedic moments, a few actually awesome action scenes and a bit of intrigue at how things ended up as they did.

After watching the whole season and reading some of the manga, I had breakfast. Just some cereal, since it had been a while since I ate it and I decided to go for it. I watched some Linus Tech Tips videos, such as *[I Built the World's Biggest Gaming TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5OIucMnw7M)* and *[The World's Stealthiest Tech Upgrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNfj2BxGIxA)*, both of which were really fun and interesting to me.

Another video that caught my attention was [a reaction to Halo 3 ODST's soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_e4X2dyqTo), without a doubt, one of my favorites of all time. I know reactions are somewhat frowned upon, but I can't help but smile and cry along, especially with masterpieces such as *Deference for Darkness* playing in the background lol.

I read some more of *Dune*, by Frank Herbert, which [I started this month](https://bookrastinating.com/user/joel/generatednote/405824#anchor-405824). I read bits during the day, and I just finished Chapter 15, where the first Sandworm finally shows up. Due to this I also decided to watch some videos about it, with various topics such as [character names pronunciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2AmCQF39wc), a [comparison of the book's physical editions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGwp1mCshzs) and the like.

I also watched *[Rotation without Rotation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCEiVDHJmc)*, an interesting Math video about the difference between skewing and rotating in video and graphics, which was rather amusing.

For some readon I ended up listening to a random, but quite good [mashup of Plastic Love](https://youtu.be/7mZsFhtbuvc?si=NYn_FV95tkEHq564), a classic among the City Pop genre where it all fit, somehow. This made me go watch a short video about [the rise of the genre in recent years](https://youtu.be/R0DXhUF1hP8).

From there, I listened to a [live concert from Yellow Magic Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc_9fkNg6rI), that was definitely something.

I watched [a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wkz0s89NxI) [different reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4bUHYYvH8) of Childhood's End by Arthur C. Clarke, while washing the dishes.

I listened to a [city pop cover of Fly Me To The Moon](https://youtu.be/qFNOx2PczMo?si=XWnoPrrIVBQmwsdm) by Caitlin Myers, which I loved a lot, then I listened to [the version by Utada Hikaru](https://youtu.be/0oob53WeZ3A), and queued [One Last Kiss](https://youtu.be/0Uhh62MUEic) after it. Along Plastic Love and Stay with Me, these songs give me a sense of nostalgia and melancholy that I just can't quite comprehend, but I enjoy them all very much.

Before the day ends I think I'll try and read some more Dune, but first, I'll upload this post, take a shower, and see what happens next.

This is day 22 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
