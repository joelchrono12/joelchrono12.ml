Hey, a new week is upon us, and I have managed to do quite a bit of stuff. As always, it went faster than I expected, but it wasn't too fast either. Pretty alright I'd say.

- üéÆ My CRKD NitroDeck arrived! So far so good! It's quite chonky but also pretty comfortable, I like the feel of the buttons and I used it quite a bit to play Breath of The Wild on the go. It definitely became part of my Switch whenever I bring it to my work commute.
- üì¶ On Thursday, some videogames I ordered from Play Asia finally showed up, after a couple of weeks. I ordered **Signalis**, a survival horror inspired by the PS1 style of the original Resident Evil trilogy, Parasite Eve and Silent Hill. But the reason I ordered at all was **The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy**, a videogame that I've heard a lot of praise for, mixing visual novel with tactics rpg elements and a really ambitious story with 100 endings, of various quality. Once again I had to visit the post office in person to pick up these games because the mailer couldn't find my house. They asked for my ID and I didn't have it, but I had a pdf scan and thankfully that worked, I'm glad, because it would've been a pain to not be able to get it until the next day.
- üì¶ On Saturday, some videogames I pre-ordered last year finally arrived from Limited Run Games. I'm talking about **Yakuza Kiwami** and **Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord**. I am looking forward to playing both, at some point when I actually chew through my Nintendo Switch backlog...
- üõçÔ∏è This week there was a huge sale going on that made it so the Nintendo Switch 2 was almost the same price as the US, which is *already* quite expensive, but yeah the tax in my country is painful and the main thing keeping me from buying. Even so, I managed to hold on and didn't make yet another unnecessary purchase!
- üéâ I was home alone throughout the weekend, which was pretty fun. That's how I managed to play a bunch of The Hundred Line (see gaming section!), but I also have to admit I struggled with making proper, healthy food. Still alive though.
- üßë‚Äçüíª I was meaning to participate in game jam, but I failed, gaming, work and procrastination, yay.
- üí™ Went to the gym last week once, and today I went too! I plan to go tomorrow as well, and try to keep it up for the rest of the year, if everything goes well. Gotta take care of what I eat as well.
- üß™ I was invited by someone on Discord to join some Nintendo playtesting thing and it should be up soon enough, I literally know nothing about it, but I am kind of interested on checking it out, just to see what's up.

## Gaming

- **The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy** - This game took over my life in a pretty similar way to what [1000xRESIST](/blog/1000xresist) achieved, with the extra advantage of me being home alone, it just was doomed to happen. Besides, I felt guilty about buying it when I [shouldn't buy games](/blog/games-to-beat-before-buying-more), so I started it almost immediately and... this is pretty good! It's tactics, it's a visual novel, it's point and click, but more than all, it was a huge project that became [the last hope for its development team](https://www.nintendolife.com/features/if-the-game-does-not-sell-well-we-may-be-done-its-do-or-die-for-too-kyo-games-and-the-hundred-line). The game really brings up a very interesting story, and there are apparently 100 endings to experience! We'll see how it goes. I am halfway through my first "route" and I am enjoying the intrigue and the gameplay quite a bit. I already played 21 hours in a weekend...
- **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild** - Of course that Zelda is still out there, I stopped playing it in the weekend, but I still achieved quite a bit! I finally beat the last Divine Beast and I am now ready to go to Hyrule Castle. However I am exploring other areas and trying to recover all of my memories first.
- **Portal 2 (Multiplayer)** - I played a few levels of the co-op mode and learning some of the mechanics of this game. I really need to play the original though, and the campaign of this one, some day...

## Reading

- **Nemesis Games** - Up to chapter 18. Glad I read a couple of chapters of this, going well!
- **Blue Lock** - Up to chapter 264. Turns out that this match is kind of hype, oops.
