Look, I don't really want this blog to be a reviews site, but I already review every game and book I complete. I don't think this will be common, because movies don't usually inspire me enough to write a whole blog post about them. But hey, I can do 400 or so words for a kid's movie, so I may as well.

Transformers One? That was a good movie, a prequel to the whole franchise, now in a fully animated form. Honestly, awesome move, I was getting tired of having like 90% of the movie be about the people. [^1]

[^1]: Although the last movie I watched from Transformers was the Bumblebee solo movie which was kinda great, I don't know how the one with Beasts is.

The story is all about how Optimus Prime and Megatron came to be, and it's honestly something I'm surprised they didn't do earlier? Maybe it was the the original cartoon, which I have never really watched, and I don't really know the franchise's lore. Regardless, the character designs abandon the greasy and reflective look of the live action movies, and are instead going back to pretty faithful recreations of the classic designs from the 80s, and I gotta say, I totally love them.

Anyway, seriously, the movie is great. The animation felt a bit jarring at first, because I'm used to the kinda slow---yet weirdly acrobatic---movements of the live action films, here the characters are snappy, and they have quite a lot of timing and moments that only work in animation form. The faces are also kinda weird, but that's just how the originals were, and it works much better as the designs *transform*. The evolution of the characters in personality and design was quite nice as well.

I am sure that true Transformers fans had a blast recognizing every single one of those obscure models and names featured in a lot of scenes. I was happy enough recognizing a couple of characters here and there and not much else. The nostalgia is real strong on this one.

But really, it was a fun movie, with great action, surprisingly good animation, especially as I got used to it, and later on during the climax of the movie, it's *chef's kiss.*

And yeah, in the end, this is a movie made to sell toys, and boy am I not eager to see little kids playing with the original designs of those awesome characters. I know I wasn't even alive in the 80s, but I still have nostalgia, I hope tons of kids get Transformers and have fun with them because those designs are still super cool and I would love to be a kid again and play too. I'm not crazy enough to start a collection of Transformers mini-figures or anything---I'm already pretty set on 
[collecting switch games](/blog/physical-game-collecting-spree/)---but I kinda wish I still had some of the ones I owned as a kid.

Anyway, good nostalgia-bait, I was entertained and enjoying myself, and that's all that matters to me, maybe I should watch the 1986 movie on YouTube now, since it's everywhere somehow.
