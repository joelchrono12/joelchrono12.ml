I always try to have a final paragraph to write things up in my blog posts, not necessarily with a heading or anything, but just the natural conclusion of writing something.

I always do this even on my monthly summaries and such, but for my weeknotes, I just don't, I list my random notes of the week and just finish the post.

I saw [RL Dane](https://fosstodon.org/@RL_Dane) sharing a post about his [every day carry](https://rldane.space/my-every-day-carry.html) and noticed that he also does not have any conclusion, just listed the things and called it a day.

Maybe I should try and do that, write what I'm going to write and stop, not everything needs to have a proper ending I guess?

Another thing I notice is that I probably use the word "anyway" and "regardless" a lot, but what else can I say?

No matter how hard I try, I'll probably still try to conclude this in some way, my previous two paragraphs already ended with unanswered questions, maybe this time it will be just a sudden break with no continuation.

But here I am, continuing again, I just think it's incomplete, maybe I will try with a quote I've used before.

Aaagh, you see, but that was the ending of my [review of Dune](/blog/dune)! ~~oops, spoilers~~, it is not fair to rehash it again for some random rambling of mine that is so off-topic and doesn't even deserve such a great quote in it.

At this point, I'm just trying to keep you reading a completely non-sensical text, but did it work? If it did and you reached this point of the article, comment your favorite fruit in an email or comments below!

Such a cheap way to create engagement, I know, I can't end this article with such a tactic, it has to be fair and square---but please, do that random comment anyway. 😉

Honestly, I'm just trying to reach a word count at this point, you can really go read something else now, I beg of you.

And done, this should be right around 400 words now, good job me! See you around my dear reader! Until later.
