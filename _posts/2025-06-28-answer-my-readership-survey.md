Shamelessly copying [misu](https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/misu-survey/), I have decided to do a quick survey for you, dear reader.

Yeah, *I want to know everything about you...*

So, please, [**answer my survey!**](https://tally.so/r/w2Yvx9)

If you want, you can just send your answers by [contacting me elsewhere](/contact)

- How old are you?
- What's your gender?
- What's your country? 
- Have you interacted with me before? (socials, chat, etc)
- How do you interact with my blog? (rss, website, other)
- How long have you been reading me? (years, months?)
- How did you find my website (other sites? looking something up?)
- Do you have a blog? (please share it!)
- How many websites do you follow regularly?
- Why do you read my website? (be as detailed as you want!)
- What posts of mine do you like the most? (link them or something :P)
- What other blogs do you like? (link link link!)
- Any feedback, tips or requests? (be kind pls say)
- Anything else? (wanna show me something cool?)

I am looking forward to this. I don't really know the actual reach I have, to be honest! Even if this was sitting on your RSS reader for a while or whatever, feel free to answer anytime!

Also, I may or may not make an updated blogpost sharing some of the general stats and results I get from this, so just keep that in mind in case it concerns you.

Thank you so much for reading me!

This is day 90 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
