As I mentioned on my delayed weeknotes yesterday, I have too many posts I want to write, and not enough time to do it! I would say that this is a time management issue, maybe I am doing more than I can chew, or maybe I am just procrastinating a lot.

I am still doing most of my writing at work on notepad++ or on my phone when I can, but despite that, I feel strangely overwhelmed with things I need to do, and I am not quite sure where to begin to take the weight off my shoulders. Since I took some vacation time away from my computer I did zero progress for like a whole week, I enjoyed it a lot, but now that I'm back I feel like I could have done progress on some pending tasks and blog posts.

First and foremost, a couple of paid commissions are on queue. I really need to get them done, but I just haven't. It's no excuse since I could have finished even earlier and I've already been on my regular schedule for 3 days, I don't really let the stress get to me much, and I shove it off most of the time, but then I feel bad, and yet, not bad enough to get it done once and for all. I really need to work on them now. I am so sorry if I owe you something right now. I am tryingggg.

Even with the guilt lingering on my mind, I still want to dedicate time for myself, and I have some time to do just that. Reading has remained strong, I can read at work during dead times and breaks, be it manga or books, it's the one that has suffered the least among my hobbies. And I don't feel bad about it because I can't really do any of my other pending tasks while I'm at my workplace---maybe I shouldn't be reading at my workplace either but anyway.

Other than those commisions, I am still working on some articles like my manga recap (which I will probably post right after this one), and my overview of 2024 as a whole, I want to do it before it becomes too late for it to make sense, and I haven't even started it.

The point is, I am actually kind of stressed? I don't know, I just wanted to ramble, I think that the weekly notes and the book reviews are starting to get to me, I want to write about more random, current and personal topics, but I also don't want to drop weeknotes when I just got started with them, and I enjoy writing my thoughts on books too.

I can't do everything I want, time is limited, I can only manage so many things. Maybe it's just the rush of the new year and all the new possibilities and commitments I've made.

Maybe deleting YouTube from my phone would help. Yeah, let's start with that.
