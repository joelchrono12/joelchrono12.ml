I am happy to say that I have managed to write a total of 100 posts during the year of 2023.

Compared to the last time I did the challenge, I wanted to be more consistent with my writing, not leaving a single month go without a couple posts at least. However, this [did not turn out that way](/blog/good-start-unsteady-step-final-sprint/), I ended being super inconsistent, not because I couldn't find the time to write at least 300 or so words per day, but because of being an eternal procrastinator who found a bunch of other things to do instead.

Despite the hundreds of hours spent on YouTube, the Fediverse, social media, my phone, at work or gaming with my psp or nintendo switch, I still managed to rush through in the end. I was meaning to post daily during December but of course I decided to skip some days and post twice in others, such as yesterday.

~~Sidenote: I've done this before and there is no rule about posting only once per day, just doing 100 posts in the span of 365 days! So don't come at me saying that I cheated! There are definitely timezones in the world where the publication of those posts happened in different days! Everything is relative, my dear reader! ðŸ˜Ž~~

And now, the challenge is finally over, the year has finally ended, and this is quite the way to be done with it. In a few hours I'll be having dinner with my family, enjoying some time together and reflect on everything that happened this year, both the good and the bad. And tomorrow---or soon after---I'll write my post Looking back at 2023!

I am hopeful of what's coming next, many things changed and my life is completely different to last year, but I think I'll be alright. 

God bless y'all, and Happy New Year!
