I have once again, managed to reach the goal of 100 posts in one year, this time I managed to do so in record time! and with a pretty awesome consistency compared to previous years.

I didn't really expect I would be able to do this so quickly, but I guess that all the changes going on in my life have made this task easier.

[Hyde](https://lazybea.rs) keeps blaming weeknotes---he's just jealous that I finally managed to beat him---and I guess it kinda makes sense. Except that I've honestly poured much more words into them than regular blog posts would have in the past. If I didn't write weeknotes, I would have even more time to type even two blog posts for each! One could say that writing weeknotes handicapped my performance. ðŸ˜‰

Alas, I have divided the amount of posts for each of those categories that "write themselves" or that were a given, I guess:

- 28 [weeknotes](/more/tags/weeknotes)
- 7 [monthly summaries](/more/tags/weeknotes)
- 5 [videogame reviews](/more/tags/game)
- 5 [book reviews](/more/tags/book)
- 5 [blog question challenges](/more/tags/challenge)
- 3 [responses](/more/tags/response)

That makes for 50 of my posts being somewhat "automatic", something I tasked myself with writing, or where I followed a template or answered a set of questions, instead of doing something more "organic", I guess.

But I also really think I've done some of my most inspired, out of nowhere, thoughtful posts in a while. With a few replies and links to other people's blogposts, and some relatively original, interesting ideas and experiences that I decided to share.

Month by month, weeknotes and reviews were commonplace, sometimes even one after another, when a week didn't give me a lot of time to write something different, and the commitment with my weeknotes took over instead.

January is probably the "weakest" when it comes to "original" content. However, I think that all of those recaps were pretty fun, and seeing how my weeknotes started wasn't too bad either, I only wrote about [having a lot to write about](/blog/too-many-posts-to-write), without a lot of more thought-out stuff.

February was also a bit weak, with not a lot separating each weeknote, other than a quick post about [gaming on my laptop](/blog/laptop-gaming) and [storage management](/blog/storage-management-tools). A book review, a game review and the usual.

March was actually much busier! I wrote about [going outside](/blog/going-out-by-myself), some [random skills you should learn](/blog/random-cool-skills-to-have), and even [confessed my sins as a FOSS enthusiast](/blog/confessions-from-a-linux-user). Besides those rambles, I wrote some memories, such as how I got [my first console](/blog/my-first-console) or [how Google used to be kinda cool](/blog/when-google-was-cool(ish)). 

I [unsubscribed from Spotify](/blog/bye-spotify-(for-good)) and went on a deep dive sharing how I am [a fake fan of many things](/blog/i'm-a-fake-fan-of-many-things). It was quite a fruitful month, I'd like to mention---even if it was one of the "automatic" ones---that I really liked the effort I put into my delayed [anime recap for 2024](/blog/anime-recap-2024).

April remained strong, with one of the most boosted and replied to blog posts in a while: [Blogging Expectations](/blog/blogging-expectations). I shared my experience [switching to Arch](/blog/i-use-arch-btw), and [what's on my phone storage](/blog/whats-on-my-phone-storage), updating my [default apps list](/blog/default-apps-2025) as well. One of my favorites though has to be my [Casio AE-1200 review](/blog/you-only-live-twice-casio-ae1200-review), if only because of the title for it!

In May, I started one of my favorite series, which is currently on hiatus: [Videogame Franchises](/blog/videogame-franchises-1) where I wrote about some of the game series I've followed and played throughout my life! There are still some heavy-hitters I need to write about, one of these days. 

I also wrote what could be my favorite post of this year's challenge: [The constant need for a source of entertainment](/blog/the-constant-need-for-a-source-of-entertainment) which also had a lot of visibility on the fediverse, and some great replies via email too, I loved all the engagement it got, and I wrote [about that too!](/blog/reading-out). I also shared my struggles [organizing my feeds](/blog/trying-to-organize-my-feeds) and about [the music that plays in my head](/blog/music-in-my-head).

When June arrived, It was filled with game and book reviews! And I wrote another ramble about how [I used to take notes](/blog/i-used-to-take-notes), a memory/response about [how time flies](/blog/how-time-flies), and another favorite of mine, a ramble about why [not having to work](/blog/not-having-to-work-would-be-nice-but-not-like-this) should be the goal, but isn't because the world is a mess.

Gotta point out I also did a [readership survey](/blog/answer-my-readership-survey) and wrote my review of an incredible game, [1000xRESIST](/blog/1000xresist), which you should play.

In July, I finally switched things up a bit, and now that I am [giving a title to my weeknotes](/blog/2025-w27), it somehow makes it feel more like a blog post instead of a template! Still, I have shared a few posts, such as how [Casio's website failed me](/blog/casio-didnt-let-me-type-my-address), an updated [What's on my Phone](/blog/whats-on-my-phone-summer-2025) and another post that got a few responses, about [my struggles with consumerism](/blog/trying-not-to-fall-into-consumerism).

I don't plan to slow down my pace for the rest of the year, but I don't think I'll do another 100 posts before it ends, so, if I participate it'll be at the start of 2026, if all goes well.

Thanks for reading my website! I really enjoyed the engagement and the conversations around many of my posts, I've discovered quite a lot of other bloggers and members of the small web, and made quite a few new connections and friendships.

Now I only need to find what hashtag to use for the rest of my blogposts this year!

This is day 100 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
