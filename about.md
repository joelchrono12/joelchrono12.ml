## 👤 About me

Hello! I am Joel, I am just a guy who likes tech, FOSS and many other things. I was born in **Mexico**, where I still live. I am a hobby collector, fake fan of many things, foss enthusiast, videogame enjoyer, and a mechatronics engineer, working as a system admin for some company somewhere.

I write whatever comes to my mind, whenever I feel like it. It's often enough I have written [100 posts in a year](https://100daystooffload.com) 3 times since this blog started. Some common topics would be videogames, technology, ramblings about my life and such. I also write week notes and monthy summaries. Why not one or the other? well, I can do both.

My username (or nickname?) comes from Chrono, which is the main character of Chrono Trigger, a JRPG released in 1995 for the SNES, it is my favorite videogame of all time, I actually played it on my PSP, which I got as a gift in 2012, quite a year, also, 12 is the day of my birthday.

Of course, as I am very original, I just added my name to my favorite videogame's protagonist, and we end up with... you guessed it: `joelchrono`. I changed it from `joeligj12`, which used to be my user in some places, but in 2020 I got into game development, participated in multiple game jams, and then cringed because people streaming game jam games on twitch struggled to pronounce it in English, `igj` are the first letters of my full name, then I thought *Chrono* was cool enough. I originally kept the `12` at the end, but I got rid of it just to shorten it, so it's cooler.

Btw, if you mention me somewhere in the internet, please don't separate the name into "Joel Chrono", It's joelchrono, all together in lowercase, or just Joel is fine too. Thanks!

I use Linux on my computer, and my distro of choice is [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org). I use a "window manager" called dwm, instead of a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE. I still use Windows at work though, RIP.

My current smartphone (a Poco F4) is using a custom rom, [Arrow OS](https://arrowos.net/), I used to switch roms a lot in school, but I haven't messed around as much in later years. If I ever get a Pixel phone, I might resume this trend again. Instead of the default launcher, I currently prefer [KISS Launcher](https://kisslauncher.com/)

I can solve a Rubik's cube in less than 20 seconds, my record is of 9.81 seconds.

I have made some videogames using the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org), but I never did anything super advanced in my opinion. I participated in around 4 game jams, some of which were successful. You can play them on my [itch.io profile](https://joelchrono.itch.io), I should probably update them some day.

## 📰 About this page

This page was the result of going into Mastodon and getting inspired by the Fosstodon community to start my own blog. Here I can share my thoughts without having to lock them down on proprietary platforms like Facebook.

I have used Jekyll to generate this site, and while at first I used [simple.css](https://simplecss.org) for my stylesheet, it has evolved so much it became its own thing now.

The website source is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/joelchrono12/jekyll-site-test.css) and the site itself is deployed using Vercel.
