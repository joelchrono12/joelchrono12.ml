Hello! I am Joel, I am just a guy who likes tech, FOSS and many other things. I was born in **Mexico**, where I still live. I am a hobby collector, fake fan of many things, foss enthusiast, videogame enjoyer, and a mechatronics engineer, working as a system admin for some company somewhere.

I write whatever comes to my mind, whenever I feel like it. It's often enough I have written [100 posts in a year](https://100daystooffload.com) **four times** since this blog started. Some common topics would be videogames, technology, ramblings about my life and whatever other hobbies I get into. I also write week notes and monthy summaries. Why not just one? well, I can do both.

My username comes from Crono, the main character of Chrono Trigger, a JRPG released in 1995 for the SNES, it is my favorite videogame of all time. I actually played it on my PSP, which I got as a gift in 2012, right before the world ended.

Of course, as I am very original, I just added my name to my favorite videogame's protagonist, and we end up with... you guessed it: `joelchrono`. I changed it from `joeligj12`, which used to be my user in some places. In 2020 I got into game development, participated in multiple game jams, and then cringed because people streaming game jam games on Twitch struggled to pronounce it in English, `igj` are the first letters of my full name, then I thought *Chrono* was cool enough. I originally kept the `12` at the end, but I got rid of it just to shorten it.

I use Linux on my computer, and my distro of choice is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org). I built my graphical environment using `dwm`, instead of a full desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE. I still use Windows at work though, RIP.

My current smartphone is the Nothing Phone 3(a), I used to switch roms a lot with [previous phones](/blog/the-smartphones-i've-owned-so-far/), but I haven't messed around as much in later years. If I ever get a Pixel phone, I might resume this trend again. Instead of the default launcher, I currently prefer [KISS Launcher](https://kisslauncher.com/)

I can solve a Rubik's cube in less than 20 seconds, my record is of 9.81 seconds.

I have made some videogames using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), but I never did anything super advanced in my opinion. I participated in around 4 game jams, some of which were successful. You can play them on my [itch.io profile](https://joelchrono.itch.io), I should probably update them some day.

## 📰 About this page

This website is generated with Jekyll, during its infancy I used [simple.css](https://simplecss.org) to style it, but I use my own stylesheet now.

The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/joelchrono12/jekyll-site-test.css) and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.app).

This blog is the result of going into Mastodon and getting inspired by the Fosstodon community to begin writing and building my own site, without being locked down by proprietary platforms like Substack or Medium.
