## Game jams
* [Deep Into the Volcano](https://joelchrono12.itch.io/deep-into-the-volcano)
    My entry for Ludum Dare 48, a simple game with two levels where you try to escape the Lava coming towards you!
* [Swap Die Repeat](https://joelchrono12.itch.io/swap-die-repeat)
    For my first game jam! A 2D puzzle platformer made with Godot, swap characters until you die! (but try not to).
* [Cliff Hanger](https://joelchrono12.itch.io/cliff-hanger)
    Yet another 2D platformer, but you have to complete the levels in 12 seconds or less, how? By stopping time!, how? by hanging on... cliffs?
* [Only Spaceship](https://joelchrono12.itch.io/only)
    A rushed out game that is kinda wonky and broken. A spaceshooter where you survive as long as its not unfair.

## Web Design
* [FreshRSS Nord's Theme](https://github.com/joelchrono12/freshrss-nord-theme)
    A simple, basic theme you can work on top of to have the Nord color scheme in your FreshRSS instance. WIP.

## Icon Packs
* [Arcticons Icon Pack](https://github.com/Donnnno/Arcticons)
    A monotone line-based icon pack for Android where I contribute by designing icons with a focus on Free and Open Source Software.
