<article markdown="1">
I follow a lot of websites via RSS, so I decided to do a quick list of the personal blogs and digital gardens I enjoy reading whenever they appear on my feed.

I plan to grow this list in the future, but this is quite a bit already. I'll also check if the websites still post actively, if not, I'll rotate with others I've discovered that are more active!

You can also [download an OPML file](/blogroll.opml) to add all of these to your RSS reader in one fell swoop!

## Featured buttons

<article markdown="1">

These blogs and personal websites have cool buttons, so I added them. Send me your button and I'll add it too!


{% include badges_blogroll.html %}

Feel free to add my button to your site using this snippet (do not [hotlink](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlinking) it though).

<a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank"><img class= "badge" alt="joelchrono's blog" src="/assets/img/badges/joelchrono.png" /></a>
```html
<a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank"><img alt="joelchrono's blog" src="/assets/img/badges/joelchrono.png" /></a>
```
<a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/badges/joelchronopfp.png" class="badge" alt="joelchrono's blog" /></a>
```html
<a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank"><img alt="joelchrono's blog" src="/assets/img/badges/joelchronopfp.png"/></a>
